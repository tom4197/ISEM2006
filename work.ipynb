Value 'DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER: MILES D. WHITE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 2015 demonstrated our company’s fundamental ability to execute. In a year characterized by heavy macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered strong underlying growth in the top tier of our peer group. O U R O P E R A T I N G ENVIRONMENT Abbott’s response to those economic forces underscores the strength of our business, the unusual ﬂexibility provided by our broad and wellbalanced business diversity, and our proven ability to navigate challenging waters. The primary factor in our business environment in 2015 was the strong U.S. dollar. This is, of course, not a new phenomenon and is one that will continue to be felt in 2016. While we’ve grown accustomed to this and know well how to manage for it, this e Ưect was greater in 2015 than in the earlier years of this strong-dollar cycle. For instance, in 2013 the impact of exchange reduced our top line by 2.1 percent and by 2.5 percent in 2014. Last year its impact was 8.3 percent. Our business diversity, strong positions, and management acumen allowed us to manage this signiﬁcant headwind. Another major current during 2015 was concern about emerging economies. While it’s true that the growth of these markets has slowed, they continue to grow at double the rate of developed markets and, thus, still present by far the best growth opportunity in the world today. We have long experience managing through the ups and downs of international markets and we remain conﬁdent in their potential over the long term. The third major factor was price inﬂation in a record market for mergers and acquisitions. That we did no major new deals in 2015 in no way suggests that we are not as strategically attuned and ambitious as ever. We fully intend to continue building the company through focused, enhancing acquisitions, as we have continually over the past 17 years. We’ll remain active and prudent — mindful of ﬁnding the right balance of strategic ﬁt, timing, and returns that will beneﬁt shareholders over the long term. We believe we found just such an opportunity in our recent agreement to acquire Alere, the leader in point-ofcare diagnostics. O U R F O R M U L A FOR SUCCESS This was the environment we navigated in 2015 en route to delivering another successful year. We’re able to do this year after year on the basis of foundational strengths that give us the ability to execute our strategies, adjust as necessary, and seize the opportunities we choose to pursue. As detailed in this report, our company is: BALANCED Well-managed diversity has been our core strategy for many years, and we work hard to maintain it in all of the major dimensions of our business. This both o Ưers us the widest range of opportunities and safeguards us from over reliance on any particular part of our business. Business Portfolio: Abbott is composed of four large and strong core businesses: Nutrition, Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals. Together, they cover the entire spectrum of healthcare and people of all ages. This gives us the opportunity to participate in a broader range of technological and socioeconomic developments than other, more narrowly-focused companies. Markets: We now derive half of our revenue from more developed economies and half from emerging markets, providing us a very e Ưective combination of dynamism and stability. Customers: Our business today is evenly divided between traditional healthcare payors and consumers. This provides balance between products that are obtained through third parties and those that customers are ready and willing to pay for themselves. In all these fundamental aspects of our business, then, we have access to new opportunities and the ﬂexibility to pursue them, as well as protection from exposure to the ﬂuctuations of single markets. GLOBAL With our deep international experience, we’re unfazed by passing market jitters over the state of individual economies or sectors. As always, we take the long view. We know that the currency winds will again eventually shift in our favor. And, more importantly, we believe in the long-term potential of today’s emerging markets and the billions of people to whom they’re bringing opportunity and access to healthcare. As we’ve proven in years past, we have the resources, the patience, and the ability to succeed in these markets under all circumstances, and to be there and ready with favorable positions and relationships when growth again accelerates. ALIGNED In all of our businesses, Abbott is well positioned to address the most relevant needs and capture and build on emerging trends — technological or demographic, social or economic. We continually shape our business to ensure that it remains ready and able to provide what our customers need. LEADING Abbott has long been a leader in many ways: in developing new technologies, in growing market-leading products, and in business practices from corporate governance to human resources to global citizenship. What all of these come down to is competitiveness — the desire to be the best. That drive has motivated this enterprise since it was just Dr. Abbott making new and better medications by hand. That’s how we’ve delivered the second highest total shareholder return of all the companies on the S&P 500 Index since it assumed its modern form in 1957. And we’ve achieved a new level of competitiveness over the past three years as we’ve reshaped the company. We’re now leaner and more e Ưicient. ALIGNING ITS PORTFOLIO WITH SPECIFIC MARKET NEEDS AND PROVIDING SHAREHOLDERS WITH RELIABLE GROWTH AND INCOME. Advancing Science Abbott is investing in innovation that addresses some of the world’s most pressing medical needs Navigating Risk A broad portfolio and global presence help reduce the impact of challenges in any one market segment or geographic region Focusing on Growth Opportunities We’re growing our presence in markets where the opportunities and needs are high and our experience and expertise are paving the way Meeting Local Needs We are globally aligned and locally driven to address the speciﬁc health challenges of the communities in which we live and work. “WE’VE ACHIEVED A NEW LEVEL OF COMPETITIVENESS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AS WE’VE RESHAPED THE COMPANY.” 10-YEAR SHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATION Shareholders who have owned Abbott since the end of 2005 have seen a 212% increase in the value of their investment, more than double the performance of the S&P 500 and almost twice that of the Dow Jones Industrial index. than we’ve been in decades, resulting in the improved margins that have allowed us to deliver our strong results despite today’s economic headwinds. F I N A N C I A L P E R F O R M A N C E Our 2015 sales growth was 9 percent globally, excluding the impact of exchange. Due to our sharpened competitiveness, these sales produced adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 9 percent. We again raised our dividend, by more than 8 percent. This marks the 92nd consecutive year in which we’ve paid a dividend, and the 44th consecutive year that dividends have risen, maintaining our longstanding position on the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. L I F E . T O T H E F U L L E S T . What we saw in 2015, then, was a textbook Abbott performance. In navigating a challenging global environment, Abbott displayed the experience and know-how of a longstanding, long-term company, and the forwardlooking ambition of a company that keeps itself young through a relentless focus on providing its customers what they need today and want for tomorrow. That customer focus drives an important new dimension for Abbott: building our corporate brand identity. In 2015 we conducted our ﬁrst-ever corporate consumer awareness campaign. Through this highly successful e Ưort, almost a billion people around the world have learned more about our company and how it helps people live the best and healthiest lives they can. That’s what Abbott is here for. We demonstrated this again in 2015 by introducing new healthcare products and bringing them to more people around the world than ever before. By running our company in a thoughtful and responsible way we were named to the Dow-Jones Sustainability Indexes, the world’s top recognition for leadership in responsible economic, environmental, and social performance, for the 11th consecutive year. Taken as a whole, our performance, across the breadth of the company’s activities, led investors and peer companies to name us our industry’s Most Admired Company in Fortune magazine’s annual ranking for the third year in a row. We intend to not just maintain, but to improve this high level of performance. Because, at Abbott, our work is too important to do it any other way.

Value 'DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER: ABBOTT REMAINS ONE OF THE WORLD’S MOST ENDURINGLY SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES BY COMBINING EXTRAORDINARY STABILITY WITH CONTINUAL, FOCUSED EVOLUTION. 2016 OPENED THE NEXT GREAT CHAPTER IN THAT ONGOING STORY OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH. SHAPING THE COMPANY The fundamental question perpetually facing every company is, “What should we be?” Determining what ﬁ elds to be in and what opportunities to pursue is the deﬁ nitive task of business leadership. The hallmark of the past 18 years at Abbott has been an unwavering focus on this central question. We have continually shaped the company to make it stronger and more competitive in its evolving environment. 2016 was a landmark year in this regard. Our vision is ﬁ xed, clear, and ambitious: to make Abbott the world’s leading healthcare company in the markets in which we compete — the company that sets the standard in innovation, impact, and performance. To this end, we shape the company to achieve maximum competitiveness. To us, that means building signiﬁ cant and leading positions in large and growing markets. Two major strategic decisions in 2016 embody our intent in action. The ﬁ rst was our decision to sell Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) to Johnson & Johnson. When we entered the vision business seven years ago, we expected AMO — which was a leader, both technologically and commercially, in the segments in which it competed — to be the foundation of just such a position for us. And the business performed very well as a part of Abbott, gaining share and operating proﬁ tably. However, we did not see the opportunity for Abbott to expand this business into the broadbased leader we would wish to be. This change, then, provides greater opportunity for our former vision business as it joins an established leader in the ﬁ eld. Abbott, on the other hand, will pursue another market that is more closely aligned with our longterm strategies. That market is cardiovascular care, and the pivotal opportunity is our acquisition of St. Jude Medical (SJM). With SJM, we now have exactly the kind of marketleading positions that we seek in all our businesses. This includes strong positions across virtually the entire spectrum of cardiovascular specialties, and number-one or number-two positions in many of these ﬁ elds. Just as importantly, we now have one of the strongest new-product pipelines in the medical device industry. The addition of SJM caps an almost 20-year process through which we’ve very deliberately built one of the world’s premier cardiac care businesses, as well as broad-based medical-device leadership. These mirror-image actions perfectly encapsulate our strategy: we compete where we can achieve the critical mass and innovation needed to have signiﬁcant impact and achieve market leadership. BUILT TO COMPETE We’re able to achieve such positions because our businesses are consciously built around a consistent core of competitive strengths: BALANCE Our long-term stability is a direct function of the balance we work to construct and maintain between the various elements of our business. Diversity of our strengths and resources has been central to Abbott’s strategy for decades. We work continually to achieve the optimal mix across multiple dimensions of our competitive proﬁle. We don’t allow the company to become overly indexed toward any single business segment, geography, technology, customer type, or channel. Well-balanced diversity not only mitigates risk — it gives us more ways to win. PRESENCE Being a leader in a global business requires being present, visible, and known around the world — to customers, investors, business partners, governments, and the general public. This is particularly critical in Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD), our branded-generics business, where presence is the strategy. Through a steady, focused shaping process, EPD is truly becoming the business we envisioned in its creation several years ago. Now focused exclusively on faster-growing emerging markets, and with strong presence in all relevant regions thanks to our acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm, EPD is executing its model with great success, growing both sales and proﬁts. RELEVANCE This attribute goes back to that central question of “What do we want to be?” It’s a matter of understanding and providing what’s current, what’s important, what people need and want — now and in the future. To be a leading healthcare company, we have to be where the needs are greatest. To that end, we’ve aligned our businesses with the demographic trends driving the future of healthcare and of the global economy. LEADERSHIP Our other competitive advantages add up to this one. We enter businesses in order to lead them. The healthcare business is about excellence. A lower standard simply is not appropriate. The essence of the business is creating new technologies and solutions that are better than before and deliver increasing beneﬁts in critical areas of people’s health and lives. We pursue leadership in every aspect of our operations — from market position to ﬁnancial performance to corporate citizenship. But nowhere is it more important than in the innovation that is always the heartbeat of our business. And our leadership in this regard is particularly robust, as we’re enjoying a very good time for Abbott science. In 2016, Popular Science magazine, the world’s largest science and technology publication, named two Abbott products — our FreeStyle Libre glucose-monitoring system and our Absorb bioresorbable stent— to its list of the year’s 100 best inventions. And we’re delivering a comparable level of innovation in our Alinity family of diagnostic systems. This is a program of unprecedented scope and ambition that advances our entire range of diagnostic technologies to o Ưer greater e Ưiciency, ﬂexibility, and conﬁdence to customers and health systems. It’s a bold advance that embodies our approach to what we do — we aim to lead. FIN A NCIA L PERFORMANCE In 2016 these competitive strengths led us to another successful performance. Our sales grew 2.2 percent globally and were up 4.8 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange. A dominant factor in recent years, exchange was less detrimental in 2016, though still a meaningful factor. We again raised our dividend — by approximately 7 percent — marking our 93rd consecutive year of dividends paid and the 45th straight year they’ve increased. As a result, we maintained our position on the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a list of just 51 major companies that have raised dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. L I F E . TO T H E F U L L E S T. Our purpose as a company has been constant for almost 130 years now: to help people live their fullest lives through better health. Achieving that goal has required continual change and adaptation over those decades, following the advance of science and technology — and often leading it — to new knowledge and capability. Abbott has been an enduring company because we’ve never hesitated to be an evolutionary company. Changing times require changing practices. What remains unchanged is our commitment to bringing people the health innovations they need to live their best possible lives. To that end, we have again reshaped our company. Today’s Abbott is built to deliver more and better healthcare solutions, to improve more lives around the world, and to strengthen our competitiveness and accelerate our growth. That’s what a leading healthcare company does. And it’s what we’ll keep doing here at Abbott. ' has dtype incompatible with float64, please explicitly cast to a compatible dtype first.\n",

Value 'DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER: Abbott is here to create value. We do so by helping the people who use our products achieve better health. And we do so by helping our shareholders achieve ﬁnancial growth. 2017 was an outstanding year for our company in both respects. FOCUS ON THE FUTURE The way we consistently create and deliver that value is by keeping our focus squarely on the future. This year marks our company’s 130th anniversary. But our view is that we’re only as old as our last year – that Abbott is a perpetually new company with a long legacy of success that informs where we go next and how we get there. That’s a powerful combination: the experience of a company that’s succeeded for generations, and the ambition and energy of a new company with fresh opportunities. We work very deliberately to ensure that Abbott remains always relevant and current to the people we serve and to the changes taking place in our environment. To that end, we continually shape the company, strategically choosing the businesses in which we compete, the areas of research in which we invest, and the geographies in which we build, to achieve the optimal conﬁguration for success. 2017 was a watershed year in the shaping of our business for its next great era. The most conspicuous steps in this process were two major acquisitions that will be powerful drivers of our future. The ﬁrst of these was St. Jude Medical, the addition of which made Abbott a leading medical-device innovator. Second was Alere Inc., a leader in rapidtesting technologies. St. Jude and Alere both enhance our strength and presence in key businesses. We’ve long been a major global player in Diagnostics; Alere strengthens us in one of the few areas in which we weren’t already a leader. St. Jude, on the other hand, makes us a premier company across the spectrum of cardiac care, where we’d previously had leadership only in certain focused areas. It also brings us into a very promising new ﬁeld: Neuromodulation to treat chronic pain and movement disorders. We’re now the market leader in non-opioid pain-relief technology, an area of high interest and immense potential. Equally important over time is how we strengthen the company organically, through our investment in research and development. 2017 was a year of great success and productivity for Abbott innovation, with an extraordinary number of major product launches and approvals across our businesses and around the world. We have never had a more robust new-product pipeline of life-changing technologies. While this is detailed throughout this report, I’ll call out two examples of internal Abbott innovation that speak to our broad aims and capabilities. First is our FreeStyle Libre glucosemonitoring system. The FreeStyle Libre system is a leap-frogging technology, changing the way people have managed their diabetes for decades. And it clearly demonstrates our strategic approach in action: we entered this ﬁeld through acquisition, creating Abbott Diabetes Care in 2004; then developed it – strategically and technologically – into the market leader it is today. The year’s other standout example of Abbott innovation is our Alinity family of diagnostic systems. This is a project of unprecedented scope and ambition in its market – a reinvention of the way the diagnostic lab works through a simultaneous reimagining of its component systems. What’s particularly striking about this e Ưort is that it comes in a legacy business in which Abbott has long been an established leader but, nonetheless, is executing a game-changing strategy through organic R&D. SHAPING SUCCESS We continually build Abbott to achieve a carefully deﬁned proﬁle that we’ve found optimal for achieving consistently strong performance. We craft that competitive proﬁle to ensure our company is structured on these purposefully cultivated core strengths: Balance The diversity of Abbott’s business portfolio not only expands our opportunities to more areas of healthcare, it’s the key to our ability to deliver superior results. By managing a careful balance between diverse elements in our business mix, our customer base, and the markets we serve, we have more ways to win without being overly dependent on any single part of our business. Global Presence Abbott has strong commercial, manufacturing, and R&D infrastructure throughout the world’s largest and fastestgrowing markets. And our marketing e Ưorts have now brought Abbott’s corporate identity to more than three billion people worldwide. Alignment Abbott goes where signiﬁcant health needs align with scientiﬁc opportunity in order to make the greatest impact for patients and, consequently, shareholders. Our ability to understand the needs of our customers allows us to move with the evolution of our markets. Leadership Our intent is to be the leading company in the markets in which we compete. And we’re fulﬁlling that objective, with #1 or #2 positions in virtually every market we serve. CREATING VALUE The results of the steps we’ve taken bear out the strategies behind them. The amount of value Abbott has created – near- and long-term – is extraordinary. Our company performed very well in 2017, and the result was a stellar year for Abbott shares. Our stock grew almost 50 percent in 2017 – its best performance in 20 years – hitting more than 20 all-time highs along the way. Combined with dividends paid, this resulted in total shareholder return of 52 percent, the best in our fundamental peer group. And, for the long term, we’ve paid rising dividends for the past 46 consecutive years, keeping us a member of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index since its inception. We’re able to create great value ﬁnancially because we ﬁrst do so in the lives of the people who use our products and for others whose lives we touch. In 2017, our e Ưorts in global citizenship led us to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes for the 13th consecutive year, the ﬁfth in a row as the leader in our industry. As a result of this strong performance across our operations, Fortune magazine recently named us the Most Admired Company in our industry, also for the ﬁfth consecutive year. 2017 was, then, a landmark year of building and putting the pieces in place for our next leap forward. In the years ahead we will capitalize on those investments and advancements. As this report makes clear, we are superbly positioned to do so. Thanks to our continual shaping of the company, Abbott is in a range of businesses, geographies, and technologies that will allow us to keep growing, evolving, and succeeding. With our eyes always on the way ahead, our company is new again, for the 130th time, and readier than ever to create the ultimate value – in human lives improved and potential realized.

                  "DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER: MILES D. WHITE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 2015 demonstrated our company’s fundamental ability to execute. In a year characterized by heavy macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered strong underlying growth in the top tier of our peer group. O U R O P E R A T I N G ENVIRONMENT Abbott’s response to those economic forces underscores the strength of our business, the unusual ﬂexibility provided by our broad and wellbalanced business diversity, and our proven ability to navigate challenging waters. The primary factor in our business environment in 2015 was the strong U.S. dollar. This is, of course, not a new phenomenon and is one that will continue to be felt in 2016. While we’ve grown accustomed to this and know well how to manage for it, this e Ưect was greater in 2015 than in the earlier years of this strong-dollar cycle. For instance, in 2013 the impact of exchange reduced our top line by 2.1 percent and by 2.5 percent in 2014. Last year its impact was 8.3 percent. Our business diversity, strong positions, and management acumen allowed us to manage this signiﬁcant headwind. Another major current during 2015 was concern about emerging economies. While it’s true that the growth of these markets has slowed, they continue to grow at double the rate of developed markets and, thus, still present by far the best growth opportunity in the world today. We have long experience managing through the ups and downs of international markets and we remain conﬁdent in their potential over the long term. The third major factor was price inﬂation in a record market for mergers and acquisitions. That we did no major new deals in 2015 in no way suggests that we are not as strategically attuned and ambitious as ever. We fully intend to continue building the company through focused, enhancing acquisitions, as we have continually over the past 17 years. We’ll remain active and prudent — mindful of ﬁnding the right balance of strategic ﬁt, timing, and returns that will beneﬁt shareholders over the long term. We believe we found just such an opportunity in our recent agreement to acquire Alere, the leader in point-ofcare diagnostics. O U R F O R M U L A FOR SUCCESS This was the environment we navigated in 2015 en route to delivering another successful year. We’re able to do this year after year on the basis of foundational strengths that give us the ability to execute our strategies, adjust as necessary, and seize the opportunities we choose to pursue. As detailed in this report, our company is: BALANCED Well-managed diversity has been our core strategy for many years, and we work hard to maintain it in all of the major dimensions of our business. This both o Ưers us the widest range of opportunities and safeguards us from over reliance on any particular part of our business. Business Portfolio: Abbott is composed of four large and strong core businesses: Nutrition, Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals. Together, they cover the entire spectrum of healthcare and people of all ages. This gives us the opportunity to participate in a broader range of technological and socioeconomic developments than other, more narrowly-focused companies. Markets: We now derive half of our revenue from more developed economies and half from emerging markets, providing us a very e Ưective combination of dynamism and stability. Customers: Our business today is evenly divided between traditional healthcare payors and consumers. This provides balance between products that are obtained through third parties and those that customers are ready and willing to pay for themselves. In all these fundamental aspects of our business, then, we have access to new opportunities and the ﬂexibility to pursue them, as well as protection from exposure to the ﬂuctuations of single markets. GLOBAL With our deep international experience, we’re unfazed by passing market jitters over the state of individual economies or sectors. As always, we take the long view. We know that the currency winds will again eventually shift in our favor. And, more importantly, we believe in the long-term potential of today’s emerging markets and the billions of people to whom they’re bringing opportunity and access to healthcare. As we’ve proven in years past, we have the resources, the patience, and the ability to succeed in these markets under all circumstances, and to be there and ready with favorable positions and relationships when growth again accelerates. ALIGNED In all of our businesses, Abbott is well positioned to address the most relevant needs and capture and build on emerging trends — technological or demographic, social or economic. We continually shape our business to ensure that it remains ready and able to provide what our customers need. LEADING Abbott has long been a leader in many ways: in developing new technologies, in growing market-leading products, and in business practices from corporate governance to human resources to global citizenship. What all of these come down to is competitiveness — the desire to be the best. That drive has motivated this enterprise since it was just Dr. Abbott making new and better medications by hand. That’s how we’ve delivered the second highest total shareholder return of all the companies on the S&P 500 Index since it assumed its modern form in 1957. And we’ve achieved a new level of competitiveness over the past three years as we’ve reshaped the company. We’re now leaner and more e Ưicient. ALIGNING ITS PORTFOLIO WITH SPECIFIC MARKET NEEDS AND PROVIDING SHAREHOLDERS WITH RELIABLE GROWTH AND INCOME. Advancing Science Abbott is investing in innovation that addresses some of the world’s most pressing medical needs Navigating Risk A broad portfolio and global presence help reduce the impact of challenges in any one market segment or geographic region Focusing on Growth Opportunities We’re growing our presence in markets where the opportunities and needs are high and our experience and expertise are paving the way Meeting Local Needs We are globally aligned and locally driven to address the speciﬁc health challenges of the communities in which we live and work. “WE’VE ACHIEVED A NEW LEVEL OF COMPETITIVENESS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AS WE’VE RESHAPED THE COMPANY.” 10-YEAR SHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATION Shareholders who have owned Abbott since the end of 2005 have seen a 212% increase in the value of their investment, more than double the performance of the S&P 500 and almost twice that of the Dow Jones Industrial index. than we’ve been in decades, resulting in the improved margins that have allowed us to deliver our strong results despite today’s economic headwinds. F I N A N C I A L P E R F O R M A N C E Our 2015 sales growth was 9 percent globally, excluding the impact of exchange. Due to our sharpened competitiveness, these sales produced adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 9 percent. We again raised our dividend, by more than 8 percent. This marks the 92nd consecutive year in which we’ve paid a dividend, and the 44th consecutive year that dividends have risen, maintaining our longstanding position on the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. L I F E . T O T H E F U L L E S T . What we saw in 2015, then, was a textbook Abbott performance. In navigating a challenging global environment, Abbott displayed the experience and know-how of a longstanding, long-term company, and the forwardlooking ambition of a company that keeps itself young through a relentless focus on providing its customers what they need today and want for tomorrow. That customer focus drives an important new dimension for Abbott: building our corporate brand identity. In 2015 we conducted our ﬁrst-ever corporate consumer awareness campaign. Through this highly successful e Ưort, almost a billion people around the world have learned more about our company and how it helps people live the best and healthiest lives they can. That’s what Abbott is here for. We demonstrated this again in 2015 by introducing new healthcare products and bringing them to more people around the world than ever before. By running our company in a thoughtful and responsible way we were named to the Dow-Jones Sustainability Indexes, the world’s top recognition for leadership in responsible economic, environmental, and social performance, for the 11th consecutive year. Taken as a whole, our performance, across the breadth of the company’s activities, led investors and peer companies to name us our industry’s Most Admired Company in Fortune magazine’s annual ranking for the third year in a row. We intend to not just maintain, but to improve this high level of performance. Because, at Abbott, our work is too important to do it any other way. ",
                  "DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER: ABBOTT REMAINS ONE OF THE WORLD’S MOST ENDURINGLY SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES BY COMBINING EXTRAORDINARY STABILITY WITH CONTINUAL, FOCUSED EVOLUTION. 2016 OPENED THE NEXT GREAT CHAPTER IN THAT ONGOING STORY OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH. SHAPING THE COMPANY The fundamental question perpetually facing every company is, “What should we be?” Determining what ﬁ elds to be in and what opportunities to pursue is the deﬁ nitive task of business leadership. The hallmark of the past 18 years at Abbott has been an unwavering focus on this central question. We have continually shaped the company to make it stronger and more competitive in its evolving environment. 2016 was a landmark year in this regard. Our vision is ﬁ xed, clear, and ambitious: to make Abbott the world’s leading healthcare company in the markets in which we compete — the company that sets the standard in innovation, impact, and performance. To this end, we shape the company to achieve maximum competitiveness. To us, that means building signiﬁ cant and leading positions in large and growing markets. Two major strategic decisions in 2016 embody our intent in action. The ﬁ rst was our decision to sell Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) to Johnson & Johnson. When we entered the vision business seven years ago, we expected AMO — which was a leader, both technologically and commercially, in the segments in which it competed — to be the foundation of just such a position for us. And the business performed very well as a part of Abbott, gaining share and operating proﬁ tably. However, we did not see the opportunity for Abbott to expand this business into the broadbased leader we would wish to be. This change, then, provides greater opportunity for our former vision business as it joins an established leader in the ﬁ eld. Abbott, on the other hand, will pursue another market that is more closely aligned with our longterm strategies. That market is cardiovascular care, and the pivotal opportunity is our acquisition of St. Jude Medical (SJM). With SJM, we now have exactly the kind of marketleading positions that we seek in all our businesses. This includes strong positions across virtually the entire spectrum of cardiovascular specialties, and number-one or number-two positions in many of these ﬁ elds. Just as importantly, we now have one of the strongest new-product pipelines in the medical device industry. The addition of SJM caps an almost 20-year process through which we’ve very deliberately built one of the world’s premier cardiac care businesses, as well as broad-based medical-device leadership. These mirror-image actions perfectly encapsulate our strategy: we compete where we can achieve the critical mass and innovation needed to have signiﬁcant impact and achieve market leadership. BUILT TO COMPETE We’re able to achieve such positions because our businesses are consciously built around a consistent core of competitive strengths: BALANCE Our long-term stability is a direct function of the balance we work to construct and maintain between the various elements of our business. Diversity of our strengths and resources has been central to Abbott’s strategy for decades. We work continually to achieve the optimal mix across multiple dimensions of our competitive proﬁle. We don’t allow the company to become overly indexed toward any single business segment, geography, technology, customer type, or channel. Well-balanced diversity not only mitigates risk — it gives us more ways to win. PRESENCE Being a leader in a global business requires being present, visible, and known around the world — to customers, investors, business partners, governments, and the general public. This is particularly critical in Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD), our branded-generics business, where presence is the strategy. Through a steady, focused shaping process, EPD is truly becoming the business we envisioned in its creation several years ago. Now focused exclusively on faster-growing emerging markets, and with strong presence in all relevant regions thanks to our acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm, EPD is executing its model with great success, growing both sales and proﬁts. RELEVANCE This attribute goes back to that central question of “What do we want to be?” It’s a matter of understanding and providing what’s current, what’s important, what people need and want — now and in the future. To be a leading healthcare company, we have to be where the needs are greatest. To that end, we’ve aligned our businesses with the demographic trends driving the future of healthcare and of the global economy. LEADERSHIP Our other competitive advantages add up to this one. We enter businesses in order to lead them. The healthcare business is about excellence. A lower standard simply is not appropriate. The essence of the business is creating new technologies and solutions that are better than before and deliver increasing beneﬁts in critical areas of people’s health and lives. We pursue leadership in every aspect of our operations — from market position to ﬁnancial performance to corporate citizenship. But nowhere is it more important than in the innovation that is always the heartbeat of our business. And our leadership in this regard is particularly robust, as we’re enjoying a very good time for Abbott science. In 2016, Popular Science magazine, the world’s largest science and technology publication, named two Abbott products — our FreeStyle Libre glucose-monitoring system and our Absorb bioresorbable stent— to its list of the year’s 100 best inventions. And we’re delivering a comparable level of innovation in our Alinity family of diagnostic systems. This is a program of unprecedented scope and ambition that advances our entire range of diagnostic technologies to o Ưer greater e Ưiciency, ﬂexibility, and conﬁdence to customers and health systems. It’s a bold advance that embodies our approach to what we do — we aim to lead. FIN A NCIA L PERFORMANCE In 2016 these competitive strengths led us to another successful performance. Our sales grew 2.2 percent globally and were up 4.8 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange. A dominant factor in recent years, exchange was less detrimental in 2016, though still a meaningful factor. We again raised our dividend — by approximately 7 percent — marking our 93rd consecutive year of dividends paid and the 45th straight year they’ve increased. As a result, we maintained our position on the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a list of just 51 major companies that have raised dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. L I F E . TO T H E F U L L E S T. Our purpose as a company has been constant for almost 130 years now: to help people live their fullest lives through better health. Achieving that goal has required continual change and adaptation over those decades, following the advance of science and technology — and often leading it — to new knowledge and capability. Abbott has been an enduring company because we’ve never hesitated to be an evolutionary company. Changing times require changing practices. What remains unchanged is our commitment to bringing people the health innovations they need to live their best possible lives. To that end, we have again reshaped our company. Today’s Abbott is built to deliver more and better healthcare solutions, to improve more lives around the world, and to strengthen our competitiveness and accelerate our growth. That’s what a leading healthcare company does. And it’s what we’ll keep doing here at Abbott. ",
                  "DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER: Abbott is here to create value. We do so by helping the people who use our products achieve better health. And we do so by helping our shareholders achieve ﬁnancial growth. 2017 was an outstanding year for our company in both respects. FOCUS ON THE FUTURE The way we consistently create and deliver that value is by keeping our focus squarely on the future. This year marks our company’s 130th anniversary. But our view is that we’re only as old as our last year – that Abbott is a perpetually new company with a long legacy of success that informs where we go next and how we get there. That’s a powerful combination: the experience of a company that’s succeeded for generations, and the ambition and energy of a new company with fresh opportunities. We work very deliberately to ensure that Abbott remains always relevant and current to the people we serve and to the changes taking place in our environment. To that end, we continually shape the company, strategically choosing the businesses in which we compete, the areas of research in which we invest, and the geographies in which we build, to achieve the optimal conﬁguration for success. 2017 was a watershed year in the shaping of our business for its next great era. The most conspicuous steps in this process were two major acquisitions that will be powerful drivers of our future. The ﬁrst of these was St. Jude Medical, the addition of which made Abbott a leading medical-device innovator. Second was Alere Inc., a leader in rapidtesting technologies. St. Jude and Alere both enhance our strength and presence in key businesses. We’ve long been a major global player in Diagnostics; Alere strengthens us in one of the few areas in which we weren’t already a leader. St. Jude, on the other hand, makes us a premier company across the spectrum of cardiac care, where we’d previously had leadership only in certain focused areas. It also brings us into a very promising new ﬁeld: Neuromodulation to treat chronic pain and movement disorders. We’re now the market leader in non-opioid pain-relief technology, an area of high interest and immense potential. Equally important over time is how we strengthen the company organically, through our investment in research and development. 2017 was a year of great success and productivity for Abbott innovation, with an extraordinary number of major product launches and approvals across our businesses and around the world. We have never had a more robust new-product pipeline of life-changing technologies. While this is detailed throughout this report, I’ll call out two examples of internal Abbott innovation that speak to our broad aims and capabilities. First is our FreeStyle Libre glucosemonitoring system. The FreeStyle Libre system is a leap-frogging technology, changing the way people have managed their diabetes for decades. And it clearly demonstrates our strategic approach in action: we entered this ﬁeld through acquisition, creating Abbott Diabetes Care in 2004; then developed it – strategically and technologically – into the market leader it is today. The year’s other standout example of Abbott innovation is our Alinity family of diagnostic systems. This is a project of unprecedented scope and ambition in its market – a reinvention of the way the diagnostic lab works through a simultaneous reimagining of its component systems. What’s particularly striking about this e Ưort is that it comes in a legacy business in which Abbott has long been an established leader but, nonetheless, is executing a game-changing strategy through organic R&D. SHAPING SUCCESS We continually build Abbott to achieve a carefully deﬁned proﬁle that we’ve found optimal for achieving consistently strong performance. We craft that competitive proﬁle to ensure our company is structured on these purposefully cultivated core strengths: Balance The diversity of Abbott’s business portfolio not only expands our opportunities to more areas of healthcare, it’s the key to our ability to deliver superior results. By managing a careful balance between diverse elements in our business mix, our customer base, and the markets we serve, we have more ways to win without being overly dependent on any single part of our business. Global Presence Abbott has strong commercial, manufacturing, and R&D infrastructure throughout the world’s largest and fastestgrowing markets. And our marketing e Ưorts have now brought Abbott’s corporate identity to more than three billion people worldwide. Alignment Abbott goes where signiﬁcant health needs align with scientiﬁc opportunity in order to make the greatest impact for patients and, consequently, shareholders. Our ability to understand the needs of our customers allows us to move with the evolution of our markets. Leadership Our intent is to be the leading company in the markets in which we compete. And we’re fulﬁlling that objective, with #1 or #2 positions in virtually every market we serve. CREATING VALUE The results of the steps we’ve taken bear out the strategies behind them. The amount of value Abbott has created – near- and long-term – is extraordinary. Our company performed very well in 2017, and the result was a stellar year for Abbott shares. Our stock grew almost 50 percent in 2017 – its best performance in 20 years – hitting more than 20 all-time highs along the way. Combined with dividends paid, this resulted in total shareholder return of 52 percent, the best in our fundamental peer group. And, for the long term, we’ve paid rising dividends for the past 46 consecutive years, keeping us a member of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index since its inception. We’re able to create great value ﬁnancially because we ﬁrst do so in the lives of the people who use our products and for others whose lives we touch. In 2017, our e Ưorts in global citizenship led us to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes for the 13th consecutive year, the ﬁfth in a row as the leader in our industry. As a result of this strong performance across our operations, Fortune magazine recently named us the Most Admired Company in our industry, also for the ﬁfth consecutive year. 2017 was, then, a landmark year of building and putting the pieces in place for our next leap forward. In the years ahead we will capitalize on those investments and advancements. As this report makes clear, we are superbly positioned to do so. Thanks to our continual shaping of the company, Abbott is in a range of businesses, geographies, and technologies that will allow us to keep growing, evolving, and succeeding. With our eyes always on the way ahead, our company is new again, for the 130th time, and readier than ever to create the ultimate value – in human lives improved and potential realized. "

                  "“JeƯ, what does Day 2 look like?” That’s a question I just got at our most recent allhands meeting. I’ve been reminding people that it’s Day 1 for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic. “Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.” To be sure, this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow motion. An established company might harvest Day 2 for decades, but the ﬁnal result would still come. I’m interested in the question, how do you fend o Ư Day 2? What are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of Day 1, even inside a large organization? Such a question can’t have a simple answer. There will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps. I don’t know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it. Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and highvelocity decision making. True Customer Obsession There are many ways to center a business. You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more. But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality. Why? There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here’s the big one: customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisﬁed, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don’t yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf. No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and I could give you many such examples. Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen. Resist Proxies As companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it’s dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2. A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us? In a Day 2 company, you might ﬁnd it’s the second. Another example: market research and customer surveys can become proxies for customers – something that’s especially dangerous when you’re inventing and designing products. “Fifty-ﬁve percent of beta testers report being satisﬁed with this feature. That is up from 47% in the ﬁrst survey.” That’s hard to interpret and could unintentionally mislead. Good inventors and designers deeply understand their customer. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll ﬁnd on surveys. They live with the design. I’m not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the o Ưering. Then, beta testing and research can help you ﬁnd your blind spots. A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste. You won’t ﬁnd any of it in a survey. Embrace External Trends The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you ﬁght them, you’re probably ﬁghting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind. These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace. We’re in the middle of an obvious one right now: machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence. Over the past decades computers have broadly automated tasks that programmers could describe with clear rules and algorithms. Modern machine learning techniques now allow us to do the same for tasks where describing the precise rules is much harder. At Amazon, we’ve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years now. Some of this work is highly visible: our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones; the Amazon Go convenience store that uses machine vision to eliminate checkout lines; and Alexa,1 our cloud-based AI assistant. (We still struggle to keep Echo in stock, despite our best e Ưorts. A high -quality problem, but a problem. We’re working on it.) But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type – quietly but meaningfully improving core operations. Inside AWS, we’re excited to lower the costs and barriers to machine learning and AI so organizations of all sizes can take advantage of these advanced techniques. Using our pre-packaged versions of popular deep learning frameworks running on P2 compute instances (optimized for this workload), customers are already developing powerful systems ranging everywhere from early disease detection to increasing crop yields. And we’ve also made Amazon’s higher level services available in a convenient form. Amazon Lex (what’s inside Alexa), Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition remove the heavy lifting from natural language understanding, speech generation, and image analysis. They can be accessed with simple API calls – no machine learning expertise required. Watch this space. Much more to come. High-Velocity Decision Making Day 2 companies make high-quality decisions, but they make high-quality decisions slowly. To keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality, high-velocity decisions. Easy for start-ups and very challenging for large organizations. The senior team at Amazon is determined to keep our decision-making velocity high. Speed matters in business – plus a high-velocity decision making environment is more fun too. We don’t know all the answers, but here are some thoughts. First, never use a one-sizeﬁts- all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re wrong? I wrote about this in more detail in last year’s letter. 1 For something amusing, try asking, “Alexa, what is sixty factorial?” Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure. Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?” By the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a quick yes. This isn’t one way. If you’re the boss, you should do this too. I disagree and commit all the time. We recently greenlit a particular Amazon Studios original. I told the team my view: debatable whether it would be interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms aren’t that good, and we have lots of other opportunities. They had a completely di Ưerent opinion and wanted to go ahead. I wrote back right away with “I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever made.” Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment. Note what this example is not: it’s not me thinking to myself “well, these guys are wrong and missing the point, but this isn’t worth me chasing.” It’s a genuine disagreement of opinion, a candid expression of my view, a chance for the team to weigh my view, and a quick, sincere commitment to go their way. And given that this team has already brought home 11 Emmys, 6 Golden Globes, and 3 Oscars, I’m just glad they let me in the room at all! Fourth, recognize true misalignment issues early and escalate them immediately. Sometimes teams have di Ưerent objectives and fundamentally di Ưerent views. They are not aligned. No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment. Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina carries the decision. I’ve seen many examples of sincere misalignment at Amazon over the years. When we decided to invite third party sellers to compete directly against us on our own product detail pages – that was a big one. Many smart, well-intentioned Amazonians were simply not at all aligned with the direction. The big decision set up hundreds of smaller decisions, many of which needed to be escalated to the senior team. “You’ve worn me down” is an awful decision-making process. It’s slow and de-energizing. Go for quick escalation instead – it’s better. So, have you settled only for decision quality, or are you mindful of decision velocity too? Are the world’s trends tailwinds for you? Are you falling prey to proxies, or do they serve you? And most important of all, are you delighting customers? We can have the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one. But we have to choose it. A huge thank you to each and every customer for allowing us to serve you, to our shareowners for your support, and to Amazonians everywhere for your hard work, your ingenuity, and your passion. As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. It remains Day 1. Sincerely, Je Ư JeƯrey P. Bezos Founder and Chief Executive O Ưicer Amazon.com, Inc. 1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS (Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report) To our shareholders: Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by yearend, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry. But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets. We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible o Ưerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, tra Ưic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders. It’s All About the Long Term We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher proﬁtability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital. Our decisions have consistently reﬂected this focus. We ﬁrst measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise. Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeo Ưs diƯerently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may conﬁrm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy: • We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers. • We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term proﬁtability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions. • We will continue to measure our programs and the e Ưectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures. • We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a su Ưicient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay o Ư, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case. • When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash ﬂows, we’ll take the cash ﬂows. • We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments. • We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses. • We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term proﬁtability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model. • We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely aƯected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner. We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take. With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future. Obsess Over Customers From the beginning, our focus has been on o Ưering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to o Ưer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football ﬁelds), and presented it in a useful, easyto-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now o Ưer customers gift certiﬁcates, 1 -ClickSM shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling. By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997: • Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase. • Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase. • The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997. • In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the top 20. • We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy. Infrastructure During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased tra Ưic, sales, and service levels: • Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we signiﬁcantly strengthened our management team. • Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November. • Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers. • Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public oƯering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, a Ưording us substantial strategic ﬂexibility. Our Employees The past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success. It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacriﬁces and passion build Amazon.com. Goals for 1998 We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product o Ưering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are signiﬁcant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in ﬁnding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments. We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see signiﬁcant beneﬁt. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do. 1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement. Je Ưrey P.

                  "Dd “JeƯ, what does Day 2 look like?” That’s a question I just got at our most recent allhands meeting. I’ve been reminding people that it’s Day 1 for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic. “Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.” To be sure, this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow motion. An established company might harvest Day 2 for decades, but the ﬁnal result would still come. I’m interested in the question, how do you fend o Ư Day 2? What are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of Day 1, even inside a large organization? Such a question can’t have a simple answer. There will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps. I don’t know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it. Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and highvelocity decision making. True Customer Obsession There are many ways to center a business. You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more. But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality. Why? There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here’s the big one: customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisﬁed, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don’t yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf. No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and I could give you many such examples. Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen. Resist Proxies As companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it’s dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2. A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us? In a Day 2 company, you might ﬁnd it’s the second. Another example: market research and customer surveys can become proxies for customers – something that’s especially dangerous when you’re inventing and designing products. “Fifty-ﬁve percent of beta testers report being satisﬁed with this feature. That is up from 47% in the ﬁrst survey.” That’s hard to interpret and could unintentionally mislead. Good inventors and designers deeply understand their customer. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll ﬁnd on surveys. They live with the design. I’m not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the o Ưering. Then, beta testing and research can help you ﬁnd your blind spots. A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste. You won’t ﬁnd any of it in a survey. Embrace External Trends The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you ﬁght them, you’re probably ﬁghting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind. These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace. We’re in the middle of an obvious one right now: machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence. Over the past decades computers have broadly automated tasks that programmers could describe with clear rules and algorithms. Modern machine learning techniques now allow us to do the same for tasks where describing the precise rules is much harder. At Amazon, we’ve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years now.

High-Velocity Decision Making Day 2 companies make high-quality decisions, but they make high-quality decisions slowly.

Are you falling prey to proxies, or do they serve you? And most important of all, are you delighting customers? We can have the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one. But we have to choose it.

To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in ﬁnding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments. We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see signiﬁcant beneﬁt. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do. 1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their su pport and encouragement. Je Ưrey P. Bezos Founder and Chief Executive O Ưicer Amazon.com, Inc. ",
                  "To our shareowners: The American Customer Satisfaction Index recently announced the results of its annual survey, and for the 8th year in a row customers ranked Amazon #1. The United Kingdom has a similar index, The U.K. Customer Satisfaction Index, put out by the Institute of Customer Service. For the 5th time in a row Amazon U.K. ranked #1 in that survey. Amazon was also just named the #1 business on LinkedIn’s 2018 Top Companies list, which ranks the most sought after places to work for professionals in the United States. And just a few weeks ago, Harris Poll released its annual Reputation Quotient, which surveys over 25,000 consumers on a broad range of topics from workplace environment to social responsibility to products and services, and for the 3rd year in a row Amazon ranked #1. Congratulations and thank you to the now over 560,000 Amazonians who come to work every day with unrelenting customer obsession, ingenuity, and commitment to operational excellence. And on behalf of Amazonians everywhere, I want to extend a huge thank you to customers. It’s incredibly energizing for us to see your responses to these surveys. One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static – they go up. It’s human nature. We didn’t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisﬁed. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday’s ‘wow’ quickly becomes today’s ‘ordinary’. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before. It may be because customers have such easy access to more information than ever before – in only a few seconds and with a couple taps on their phones, customers can read reviews, compare prices from multiple retailers, see whether something’s in stock, ﬁnd out how fast it will ship or be available for pick-up, and more. These examples are from retail, but I sense that the same customer empowerment phenomenon is happening broadly across everything we do at Amazon and most other industries as well. You cannot rest on your laurels in this world. Customers won’t have it. How do you stay ahead of ever-rising customer expectations? There’s no single way to do it – it’s a combination of many things. But high standards (widely deployed and at all levels of detail) are certainly a big part of it. We’ve had some successes over the years in our quest to meet the high expectations of customers. We’ve also had billions of dollars’ worth of failures along the way. With those experiences as backdrop, I’d like to share with you the essentials of what we’ve learned (so far) about high standards inside an organization. Intrinsic or Teachable? First, there’s a foundational question: are high standards intrinsic or teachable? If you take me on your basketball team, you can teach me many things, but you can’t teach me to be taller. Do we ﬁrst and foremost need to select for “high standards” people? If so, this letter would need to be mostly about hiring practices, but I don’t think so. I believe high standards are teachable. In fact, people are pretty good at learning high standards simply through exposure. High standards are contagious. Bring a new person onto a high standards team, and they’ll quickly adapt. The opposite is also true. If low standards prevail, those too will quickly spread. And though exposure works well to teach high standards, I believe you can accelerate that rate of learning by articulating a few core principles of high standards, which I hope to share in this letter. Universal or Domain Speciﬁc? Another important question is whether high standards are universal or domain speciﬁc. In other words, if you have high standards in one area, do you automatically have high standards elsewhere? I believe high standards are domain speciﬁc, and that you have to learn high standards separately in every arena of interest. When I started Amazon, I had high standards on inventing, on customer care, and (thankfully) on hiring. But I didn’t have high standards on operational process: how to keep ﬁxed problems ﬁxed, how to eliminate defects at the root, how to inspect processes, and much more. I had to learn and develop high standards on all of that (my colleagues were my tutors). Understanding this point is important because it keeps you humble. You can consider yourself a person of high standards in general and still have debilitating blind spots. There can be whole arenas of endeavor where you may not even know that your standards are low or non-existent, and certainly not world class. It’s critical to be open to that likelihood. Recognition and Scope What do you need to achieve high standards in a particular domain area? First, you have to be able to recognize what good looks like in that domain. Second, you must have realistic expectations for how hard it should be (how much work it will take) to achieve that result – the scope. Let me give you two examples. One is a sort of toy illustration but it makes the point clearly, and another is a real one that comes up at Amazon all the time. Perfect Handstands A close friend recently decided to learn to do a perfect free-standing handstand. No leaning against a wall. Not for just a few seconds. Instagram good. She decided to start her journey by taking a handstand workshop at her yoga studio. She then practiced for a while but wasn’t getting the results she wanted. So, she hired a handstand coach. Yes, I know what you’re thinking, but evidently this is an actual thing that exists. In the very ﬁrst lesson, the coach gave her some wonderful advice. “Most people,” he said, “think that if they work hard, they should be able to master a handstand in about two weeks. The reality is that it takes about six months of daily practice. If you think you should be able to do it in two weeks, you’re just going to end up quitting.” Unrealistic beliefs on scope – often hidden and undiscussed – kill high standards. To achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be – something this coach understood well. SixPage Narratives We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum. In the handstand example, it’s pretty straightforward to recognize high standards. It wouldn’t be di Ưicult to lay out in detail the requirements of a well-executed handstand, and then you’re either doing it or you’re not. The writing example is very di Ưerent. The di Ưerence between a great memo and an average one is much squishier. It would be extremely hard to write down the detailed requirements that make up a great memo. Nevertheless, I ﬁnd that much of the time, readers react to great memos very similarly. They know it when they see it. The standard is there, and it is real, even if it’s not easily describable. Here’s what we’ve ﬁgured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a highstandards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They’re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we’re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can’t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo probably should take a week or more. Skill Beyond recognizing the standard and having realistic expectations on scope, how about skill? Surely to write a world class memo, you have to be an extremely skilled writer? Is it another required element? In my view, not so much, at least not for the individual in the context of teams. The football coach doesn’t need to be able to throw, and a ﬁlm director doesn’t need to be able to act. But they both do need to recognize high standards for those things and teach realistic expectations on scope. Even in the example of writing a six-page memo, that’s teamwork. Someone on the team needs to have the skill, but it doesn’t have to be you. (As a side note, by tradition at Amazon, authors’ names never appear on the memos – the memo is from the whole team.) Beneﬁts of High Standards Building a culture of high standards is well worth the e Ưort, and there are many beneﬁts. Naturally and most obviously, you’re going to build better products and services for customers – this would be reason enough! Perhaps a little less obvious: people are drawn to high standards – they help with recruiting and retention. More subtle: a culture of high standards is protective of all the “invisible” but crucial work that goes on in every company. I’m talking about the work that no one sees. The work that gets done when no one is watching. In a high standards culture, doing that work well is its own reward – it’s part of what it means to be a professional. And ﬁnally, high standards are fun! Once you’ve tasted high standards, there’s no going back. So, the four elements of high standards as we see it: they are teachable, they are domain speciﬁc, you must recognize them, and you must explicitly coach realistic scope. For us, these work at all levels of detail. Everything from writing memos to whole new, clean-sheet business initiatives. We hope they help you too. Insist on the Highest Standards Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. -- from the Amazon Leadership Principles Recent Milestones The high standards our leaders strive for have served us well. And while I certainly can’t do a handstand myself, I’m extremely proud to share some of the milestones we hit last year, each of which represents the fruition of many years of collective e Ưort. We take none of them for granted. • Prime – 13 years post-launch, we have exceeded 100 million paid Prime members globally. In 2017 Amazon shipped more than ﬁve billion items with Prime worldwide, and more new members joined Prime than in any previous year – both worldwide and in the U.S. Members in the U.S. now receive unlimited free two- day shipping on over 100 million di Ưerent items. We expanded Prime to Mexico, Singapore, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and introduced Business Prime Shipping in the U.S. and Germany. We keep making Prime shipping faster as well, with Prime Free Same-Day and Prime Free One-Day delivery now in more than 8,000 cities and towns. Prime Now is available in more than 50 cities worldwide across nine countries. Prime Day 2017 was our biggest global shopping event ever (until surpassed by Cyber Monday), with more new Prime members joining Prime than any other day in our history. • AWS – It’s exciting to see Amazon Web Services, a $20 billion revenue run rate business, accelerate its already healthy growth. AWS has also accelerated its pace of innovation – especially in new areas such as machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence, Internet of Things, and serverless computing. In 2017, AWS announced more than 1,400 signiﬁcant services and features, including Amazon SageMaker, which radically changes the accessibility and ease of use for everyday developers to build sophisticated machine learning models. Tens of thousands of customers are also using a broad range of AWS machine learning services, with active users increasing more than 250 percent in the last year, spurred by the broad adoption of Amazon SageMaker. And in November, we held our sixth re:Invent conference with more than 40,000 attendees and over 60,000 streaming participants. • Marketplace – In 2017, for the ﬁrst time in our history, more than half of the units sold on Amazon worldwide were from our third-party sellers, including small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Over 300,000 U.S.-based SMBs started selling on Amazon in 2017, and Fulﬁllment by Amazon shipped billions of items for SMBs worldwide. Customers ordered more than 40 million items from SMBs worldwide during Prime Day 2017, growing their sales by more than 60 percent over Prime Day 2016. Our Global Selling program (enabling SMBs to sell products across national borders) grew by over 50% in 2017 and cross-border ecommerce by SMBs now represents more than 25% of total thirdparty sales. • Alexa – Customer embrace of Alexa continues, with Alexa-enabled devices among the best-selling items across all of Amazon. We’re seeing extremely strong adoption by other companies and developers that want to create their own experiences with Alexa. There are now more than 30,000 skills for Alexa from outside developers, and customers can control more than 4,000 smart home devices from 1,200 unique brands with Alexa. The foundations of Alexa continue to get smarter every day too. We’ve developed and implemented an on-device ﬁngerprinting technique, which keeps your device from waking up when it hears an Alexa commercial on TV. (This technology ensured that our Alexa Super Bowl commercial didn’t wake up millions of devices.) Far-ﬁeld speech recognition (already very good) has improved by 15% over the last year; and in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, we’ve improved Alexa’s spoken language understanding by more than 25% over the last 12 months through enhancements in Alexa’s machine learning components and the use of semi-supervised learning techniques. (These semi-supervised learning techniques reduced the amount of labeled data needed to achieve the same accuracy improvement by 40 times!) Finally, we’ve dramatically reduced the amount of time required to teach Alexa new languages by using machine translation and transfer learning techniques, which allows us to serve customers in more countries (like India and Japan). • Amazon devices – 2017 was our best year yet for hardware sales. Customers bought tens of millions of Echo devices, and Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick with Alexa were the best-selling products across all of Amazon – across all categories and all manufacturers. Customers bought twice as many Fire TV Sticks and Kids Edition Fire Tablets this holiday season versus last year. 2017 marked the release of our all-new Echo with an improved design, better sound, and a lower price; Echo Plus with a built-in smart home hub; and Echo Spot, which is compact and beautiful with a circular screen. We released our next generation Fire TV, featuring 4K Ultra HD and HDR; and the Fire HD 10 Tablet, with 1080p Full HD display. And we celebrated the 10th anniversary of Kindle by releasing the all-new Kindle Oasis, our most advanced reader ever. It’s waterproof – take it in the bathtub – with a bigger 7” high-resolution 300 ppi display and has built-in audio so you can also listen to your books with Audible. • Prime Video – Prime Video continues to drive Prime member adoption and retention. In the last year we made Prime Video even better for customers by adding new, award-winning Prime Originals to the service, like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, winner of two Critics’ Choice Awards and two Golden Globes, and the Oscar-nominated movie The Big Sick. We’ve expanded our slate of programming across the globe, launching new seasons of Bosch and Sneaky Pete from the U.S., The Grand Tour from the U.K., and You Are Wanted from Germany, while adding new Sentosha shows from Japan, along with Breathe and the awardwinning Inside Edge from India. Also this year, we expanded our Prime Channels oƯerings, adding CBS All Access in the U.S. and launching Channels in the U.K. and Germany. We debuted NFL Thursday Night Football on Prime Video, with more than 18 million total viewers over 11 games. In 2017, Prime Video Direct secured subscription video rights for more than 3,000 feature ﬁlms and committed over $18 million in royalties to independent ﬁlmmakers and other rights holders. Looking forward, we’re also excited about our upcoming Prime Original series pipeline, which includes Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan starring John Krasinski; King Lear, starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson; The Romano Ưs, executive produced by Matt Weiner; Carnival Row starring Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne; Good Omens starring Jon Hamm; and Homecoming, executive produced by Sam Esmail and starring Julia Roberts in her ﬁrst television series. We acquired the global television rights for a multi-season production of The Lord of the Rings, as well as Cortés, a miniseries based on the epic saga of Hernán Cortés from executive producer Steven Spielberg, starring Javier Bardem, and we look forward to beginning work on those shows this year. • Amazon Music – Amazon Music continues to grow fast and now has tens of millions of paid customers. Amazon Music Unlimited, our on-demand, ad- free oƯering, expanded to more than 30 new countries in 2017, and membership has more than doubled over the past six months. • Fashion – Amazon has become the destination for tens of millions of customers to shop for fashion. In 2017, we introduced our ﬁrst fashion-oriented Prime beneﬁt, Prime Wardrobe – a new service that brings the ﬁtting room directly to the homes of Prime members so they can try on the latest styles before they buy. We introduced Nike and UGG on Amazon along with new celebrity collections by Drew Barrymore and Dwyane Wade, as well as dozens of new private brands, like Goodthreads and Core10. We’re also continuing to enable thousands of designers and artists to o Ưer their exclusive designs and prints on demand through Merch by Amazon. We ﬁnished 2017 with the launch of our interactive shopping experience with Calvin Klein, including pop-up shops, on-site product customization, and ﬁtting rooms with Alexa-controlled lighting, music, and more. • Whole Foods – When we closed our acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, we announced our commitment to making high-quality, natural and organic food available for everyone, then immediately lowered prices on a selection of best-selling grocery staples, including avocados, organic brown eggs, and responsiblyfarmed salmon. We followed this with a second round of price reductions in November, and our Prime member exclusive promotion broke Whole Foods’ all-time record for turkeys sold during the Thanksgiving season. In February, we introduced free two-hour delivery on orders over $35 for Prime members in select cities, followed by additional cities in March and April, and plan continued expansion across the U.S. throughout this year. We also expanded the beneﬁts of the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Card, enabling Prime members to get 5% back when shopping at Whole Foods Market. Beyond that, customers can purchase Whole Foods’ private label products like 365 Everyday Value on Amazon, purchase Echo and other Amazon devices in over a hundred Whole Foods stores, and pick-up or return Amazon packages at Amazon Lockers in hundreds of Whole Foods stores. We’ve also begun the technical work needed to recognize Prime members at the point of sale and look forward to o Ưering more Prime beneﬁts to Whole Foods shoppers once that work is completed. • Amazon Go – Amazon Go, a new kind of store with no checkout required, opened to the public in January in Seattle. Since opening, we’ve been thrilled to hear many customers refer to their shopping experience as “magical.” What makes the magic possible is a custom-built combination of computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning, which come together to create Just Walk Out shopping. With JWO, customers are able to grab their favorite breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, and grocery essentials more conveniently than ever before. Some of our top-selling items are not surprising – caƯeinated beverages and water are popular – but our customers also love the Chicken Banh Mi sandwich, chocolate chip cookies, cut fruit, gummy bears, and our Amazon Meal Kits. • Treasure Truck – Treasure Truck expanded from a single truck in Seattle to a ﬂeet of 35 trucks across 25 U.S. cities and 12 U.K. cities. Our bubble-blowing, music-pumping trucks fulﬁlled hundreds of thousands of orders, from porterhouse steaks to the latest Nintendo releases. Throughout the year, Treasure Truck also partnered with local communities to lift spirits and help those in need, including donating and delivering hundreds of car seats, thousands of toys, tens of thousands of socks, and many other essentials to community members needing relief, from those displaced by Hurricane Harvey, to the homeless, to kids needing holiday cheer. • India – Amazon.in is the fastest growing marketplace in India, and the most visited site on both desktop and mobile, according to comScore and SimilarWeb. The Amazon.in mobile shopping app was also the most downloaded shopping app in India in 2017, according to App Annie. Prime added more members in India in its ﬁrst year than any previous geography in Amazon’s history. Prime selection in India now includes more than 40 million local products from third-party sellers, and Prime Video is investing in India original video content in a big way, including two recent premiers and over a dozen new shows in production. • Sustainability – We are committed to minimizing carbon emissions by optimizing our transportation network, improving product packaging, and enhancing energy e Ưiciency in our operations, and we have a long-term goal to power our global infrastructure using 100% renewable energy. We recently launched Amazon Wind Farm Texas, our largest wind farm yet, which generates more than 1,000,000 megawatt hours of clean energy annually from over 100 turbines. We have plans to host solar energy systems at 50 fulﬁllment centers by 2020, and have launched 24 wind and solar projects across the U.S. with more than 29 additional projects to come. Together, Amazon’s renewable energy projects now produce enough clean energy to power over 330,000 homes annually. In 2017 we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of Frustration-Free Packaging, the ﬁrst of a suite of sustainable packaging initiatives that have eliminated more than 244,000 tons of packaging materials over the past 10 years. In addition, in 2017 alone our programs signiﬁcantly reduced packaging waste, eliminating the equivalent of 305 million shipping boxes. And across the world, Amazon is contracting with our service providers to launch our ﬁrst low-pollution last-mile ﬂeet. Already today, a portion of our European delivery ﬂeet is comprised of low-pollution electric and natural gas vans and cars, and we have over 40 electric scooters and e-cargo bikes that complete local urban deliveries. • Empowering Small Business – Millions of small and medium-sized businesses worldwide now sell their products through Amazon to reach new customers around the globe. SMBs selling on Amazon come from every state in the U.S., and from more than 130 di Ưerent countries around the world. More than 140,000 SMBs surpassed $100,000 in sales on Amazon in 2017, and over a thousand independent authors surpassed $100,000 in royalties in 2017 through Kindle Direct Publishing. • Investment & Job Creation – Since 2011, we have invested over $150 billion worldwide in our fulﬁllment networks, transportation capabilities, and technology infrastructure, including AWS data centers. Amazon has created over 1.7 million direct and indirect jobs around the world. In 2017 alone, we directly created more than 130,000 new Amazon jobs, not including acquisitions, bringing our global employee base to over 560,000. Our new jobs cover a wide range of professions, from artiﬁcial intelligence scientists to packaging specialists to fulﬁllment center associates. In addition to these direct hires, we estimate that Amazon Marketplace has created 900,000 more jobs worldwide, and that Amazon’s investments have created an additional 260,000 jobs in areas like construction, logistics, and other professional services. • Career Choice – One employee program we’re particularly proud of is Amazon Career Choice. For hourly associates with more than one year of tenure, we pre-pay 95% of tuition, fees, and textbooks (up to $12,000) for certiﬁcates and associate degrees in high-demand occupations such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, machine tool technologies, medical lab technologies, and nursing. We fund education in areas that are in high demand and do so regardless of whether those skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Globally more than 16,000 associates (including more than 12,000 in the U.S.) have joined Career Choice since the program launched in 2012. Career Choice is live in ten countries and expanding to South Africa, Costa Rica, and Slovakia later this year. Commercial truck driving, healthcare, and information technology are the program’s most popular ﬁelds of study. We’ve built 39 Career Choice classrooms so far, and we locate them behind glass walls in high tra Ưic areas inside our fulﬁllment centers so associates can be inspired by seeing their peers pursue new skills. The credit for these milestones is deserved by many. Amazon is 560,000 employees. It’s also 2 million sellers, hundreds of thousands of authors, millions of AWS developers, and hundreds of millions of divinely discontent customers around the world who push to make us better each and every day. Path Ahead This year marks the 20th anniversary of our ﬁrst shareholder letter, and our core values and approach remain unchanged. We continue to aspire to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, and we recognize this to be no small or easy challenge. We know there is much we can do better, and we ﬁnd tremendous energy in the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. A huge thank you to each and every customer for allowing us to serve you, to our shareowners for your support, and to Amazonians everywhere for your ingenuity, your passion, and your high standards. As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. It remains Day 1. Sincerely, Je Ưrey P. Bezos Founder and Chief Executive O Ưicer Amazon.com, Inc. 1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS (Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report) To our shareholders: Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry. But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets. We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible o Ưerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, tra Ưic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders. It’s All About the Long Term We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher proﬁtability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital. Our decisions have consistently reﬂected this focus. We ﬁrst measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise. Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeo Ưs diƯerently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may conﬁrm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy: • We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers. • We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term proﬁtability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions. • We will continue to measure our programs and the e Ưectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures. • We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a su Ưicient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay o Ư, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case. • When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash ﬂows, we’ll take the cash ﬂows. • We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments. • We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses. • We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term proﬁtability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model. • We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely aƯected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner. We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take. With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future. Obsess Over Customers From the beginning, our focus has been on o Ưering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to o Ưer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football ﬁelds), and presented it in a useful, easyto-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now o Ưer customers gift certiﬁcates, 1 -ClickSM shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling. By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997: • Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase. • Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase. • The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997. • In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the top 20. • We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy. Infrastructure During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased tra Ưic, sales, and service levels: • Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we signiﬁcantly strengthened our management team. • Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November. • Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers. • Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public oƯering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, a Ưording us substantial strategic ﬂexibility. Our Employees The past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success. It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacriﬁces and passion build Amazon.com. Goals for 1998 We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product o Ưering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are signiﬁcant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in ﬁnding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments. We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see signiﬁcant beneﬁt. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do. 1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement. Je Ưrey P. Bezos Founder and Chief Executive O Ưicer Amazon.com, Inc. "

                  "TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, CUSTOMERS, AND ASSOCIATES7 2015 was a solid year for the bank. CVB Financial Corp. was ranked as the “Best Bank in America” by Forbes. This recognition was particularly rewarding as the rating criteria covered ten diƯerent ﬁnancial metrics and included only the 100 largest banks and thrifts based on asset size in the United States. Citizens Business Bank now has 52 center locations and nearly $8 billion in assets. We certainly have come a long way since 1974, with a single branch location in Chino, CA. We recently announced the payment of our 105th consecutive cash dividend to our shareholders and our 155th consecutive quarter of proﬁtability. These two numbers have become sources of pride within our company, representing strength and consistency in ﬁnancial performance. As we expand our footprint, our vision of becoming the premier ﬁnancial services company operating throughout the state of California becomes achievable. Our ﬁnancial success in 2015 was a result of many accomplishments made by hard working associates throughout the year. As a company, we earned $99.1 million, the second highest earnings in history. Total assets grew by $293 million, total loans grew by $196 million, and total deposits grew by $313 million. We broadened our geographic footprint, opening new Commercial Banking Center locations in Oxnard and Santa Barbara. In late 2015, we announced the acquisition of County Commerce Bank, a highly-regarded community bank headquartered in Ventura County with four locations. This acquisition expands our presence into the south central coastal area of California, where we now have six locations in the Ventura/Santa Barbara County region. Throughout the course of time, our commitment to our shareholders has not changed. We make business decisions that are consistent with our ﬁve core values: ﬁnancial strength, superior people, customer focus, cost- eƯective operation, and having fun.

We demonstrated our continued strength through solid ﬁnancial results and growth. CVB Financial Corp. was once again ranked as one of the “Best Banks in America” by Forbes. Receiving this recognition for the eighth consecutive year validates our commitment to being the premier ﬁnancial services company in California. Citizens Business Bank currently operates ﬁfty- four banking centers and three trust o Ưice locations serving Southern and Central California with nearly $8.1 billion in assets. We reported net income of $101.4 million, our second highest in company history. Total assets increased $402.5 million from 2015, while total loans grew $378.1 million and total deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased by $304.7 million. Signiﬁcant strides were made toward expanding our geographic footprint. We acquired County Commerce Bank in February 2016, adding four new locations along the south central coast of California: Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo, and Westlake Village. We also recently accquired Valley Business Bank, a community bank located in the Central Valley with approximately $416 million in assets. The acquisition closed on March 10, 2017. This is our third bank acquired over the past three years, starting with American Security Bank, purchased in May 2014 and headquartered in Newport Beach. Our growth strategy not only includes acquisitions, but also same store sales and the opening of de novo centers. Over the past few years, we have opened new center locations in Santa Barbara and San Diego and recruited new banking teams into Visalia, Los Angeles, Oxnard, and Newport Beach. We set goals for each of our center locations to increase loans, deposits, and fee income each year. To support our expanding footprint, we recently purchased a new building in Rancho Cucamonga, CA to house our central operations and technology personnel, along with several other bank departments. This new facility should provide the infrastructure to support continued growth for many years to come. Our new building should be ready for occupancy in March 2017. The consistency of our strong ﬁnancial performance is represented by our 159th consecutive quarter of proﬁtability and our 109th consecutive cash dividend paid to shareholders.

Citizens Business Bank now consists of 51 banking centers, three trust o Ưice locations, and over $8.2 billion in total assets. We also own two 50,000 square foot buildings in the greater Ontario area, a mere two miles apart. These buildings house administration and all support departments including Credit, Human Resources, Marketing, Centralized Operations, Technology, and more. The close proximity of these buildings promotes eƯiciency and teamwork.

Credit quality and proﬁt margins also improved year-over-year. In terms of expansion, we completed the acquisition of Valley Business Bank in March of 2017. Valley Business Bank provided over $400 million in new assets and signiﬁcant additional opportunities for future growth in the Fresno, Visalia, and Tulare markets. New locations were opened in San Diego and Stockton to expand our geographic presence. We also added a new Director to our Board. Rodrigo Guerra, Jr. joined CVBF in July 2017.

                  "I am pleased to write you about another successful year for Hibbett Sports. The Company rallied like a true competitor as ﬁscal 2015 came to a close, with growing momentum in sales and earnings. We look to maintain this momentum in ﬁscal 2016 as we continue to make progress on major initiatives that will sharpen our game on the fundamentals that have historically delivered exceptional long-term returns. Our model of convenience, brands, and service continues to be the core of what we do, and we will continue to enhance this model as we focus on improving the customer experience. Our competitive spirit is as strong as ever, and we look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. Net sales for ﬁscal 2015 rose 7% to $913.5 million, while comparable store sales for the year increased 2.9%. Full year earnings per diluted share increased 6% to $2.87. The ﬁnal quarter of ﬁscal 2015 reﬂected the strongest year-over-year increases in sales and earnings, as we took advantage of increased consumer demand through excellent customer service, product assortments, operational excellence, and support from the entire Hibbett team and all of our suppliers. Reﬂecting this performance, our balance sheet remained as strong as ever, as we ended the year with a cash position exceeding $88 million, no debt, and credit availability totaling $80 million under our lines of credit. Our capital allocation strategy continues to drive impressive shareholder returns, and we continue to invest in our future earnings potential through continued store growth, investment in major initiatives, and the repurchase of our common shares. During ﬁscal 2015, we repurchased more than 1.2 million common shares, representing an expenditure of approximately $61 million. Our small-box strategy, with stores of approximately 5,000 square feet, remains at the core of our business model and continues to serve us well. This approach allows us to be nimble as we enter smaller areas that cannot eƯectively support big -box competition. Even as some markets become viable for larger sporting goods stores, we diƯerentiate through greater convenience, excellent customer service, and the unique product focus we o Ưer our customers. For ﬁscal 2015, we delivered a record year of store growth, opening 80 new stores, closing 19 under-performing stores, and expanding 9 high-performing stores. We ended the year at 988 stores and expect to open our 1,000th store in the spring of ﬁscal 2016. For ﬁscal 2016, we expect to open 80-85 stores, close 15- 20 under-performing stores, and expand 10-15 existing stores. We are conﬁdent that we can reach our goal of 1,300 stores by ﬁscal 2019. We made signiﬁcant progress on our major initiatives in ﬁscal 2015 and are starting to see early positive results. We completed the rollout of our labor management system, and our stores are using this capability to service our customers more e Ưectively than ever. Our markdown optimization system has been fully deployed across all major categories, and we are starting to see the long-term beneﬁt this system can provide. This system uses a highly predictive and proven approach to quickly address slow selling and aged inventory and helps instill discipline in our merchandising e Ưorts. As it continues to accumulate more and more product history, we expect the system will further smooth markdown trends and boost gross margin. Our new wholesale and logistics facility continues to exceed our expectations, and we have been impressed with the productivity this facility provides. We are especially excited about the ability to hold back quantities of new product releases, which can be shipped later to speciﬁc stores as demand trends emerge, rather than experience store-bystore overstocks or shortages. We also recently completed the ﬁrst phase of our business intelligence system, which will give us better insight into the business and will allow us to make more timely adjustments to better serve our customers. We will continue to drive value from our existing initiatives and are excited to begin our journey on our next major initiative of enabling a true omni-channel experience for our customers. The initiative begins with the implementation of a new point-of-sale system, which will give us real-time inventory visibility across the chain, allowing stores to quickly locate items and improve our sales conversion rate. As part of this phase, we will also implement a customer relationship management tool, which will allow us to communicate with our customers in a more meaningful way. Longer term, with those pieces in place, we will commence the last phase of our omnichannel strategy with the development of a true e-commerce site, enabling our customers to purchase directly from Hibbett Sports online. Our ﬂoor plans are designed with multiple aisle ways that allow the stores to be user friendly, feature more product, and implement seasonal initiatives throughout the year. Hibbett Sports continues to target the core footwear, apparel and equipment interests of our customers. We’ve successfully executed this strategy for almost 20 years as a public company, and we have teamed with leading brands like Nike, Under Armour and adidas to o Ưer our customers premium products backed by convenient locations and unmatched customer service. Our brand message, embodied in our corporate slogan “A Constant State of Game” continues to resonate increasingly with customers, as indicated by our MVP loyalty program that increased 23% to more than 4.6 million members last year. All of these factors encourage a strong sense of optimism and conﬁdence of our team regarding the long-term performance potential of our company. I would like to thank over 8,000 employees in our stores, wholesale and logistics facility, and store support center for making this possible and for their continued dedication and commitment. On behalf of the Board of Directors, management and our employees, please accept our gratitude for your continued support and investment with us. Sincerely, JeƯry O. Rosenthal Chief Executive O Ưicer and President ",
                  "During Fiscal 2016, Hibbett Sports continued to make progress with a number of key strategies that will strengthen our business over the long term and better position us to capitalize on signiﬁcant opportunities ahead. Our core strategic pillars of convenience, brands and service continued to serve us very well as we grew our store base during the year to reach even more customers in the small markets we serve. Expanding our store base will remain a key component of our growth in the future, and we are excited to take this strategy to the next level with the ongoing development of a full omni-channel capability. Our store base will ultimately play a key role in our omni-channel strategy, and we feel we are still in the early stages of realizing the chain’s full potential. Just as in a marathon, where success depends on planning, training and endurance, we are pleased by the way Hibbett Sports competed this past year and are encouraged by the Company’s pace for the future. Our sales performance in Fiscal 2016 was driven by broad- based strength in our footwear business, as we continued to o Ưer the latest styles and technology that drive consumer demand. Our apparel business was weaker, however, and we see this as a signiﬁcant opportunity as we enter Fiscal 2017. Overall, we experienced weaker-than-expected sales for the year and a related deleveraging impact on margins and expenses. Net sales for Fiscal 2016 rose 3% to $943.1 million, while comparable store sales for the year declined 0.4%. Earnings per diluted share for Fiscal 2016 increased 2% to $2.92. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the signiﬁcant progress we are making on our assortments and in-stock position, and feel we are well positioned to capitalize on these improvements in Fiscal 2017. Hibbett Sports again ended the year with a strong balance sheet, highlighted by $32.3 million of available cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, at year’s end, we had no bank debt outstanding and had full availability under our $80.0 million unsecured credit facilities. This ﬁnancial strength continues to support our store expansion program, the investments in major initiatives, and a robust share buyback plan. During Fiscal 2016, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $91 million, which helped drive our earnings per share growth. Late in the year, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase authorization of $300 million, and the entire authorization was available for future stock repurchases as of January 30, 2016. A central and successful aspect of our business model continues to be our small-box strategy, which is based on stores of approximately 5,000 square feet. It allows us to focus on a limited, but more proﬁtable selection and provides us with increased agility to expand to smaller towns that big-box competitors ﬁnd unworkable or impractical. Even as some markets become viable for larger sporting goods stores, we have remained successful in counterbalancing that impact with even more small-town stores, as we continue to deliver greater convenience, excellent customer service, and a more premium product focus. In terms of physical expansion, Fiscal 2016 was historic in many respects. In May, we opened our 1,000th store. We also entered two new states during the year, New York and New Jersey, on the way to opening a total of 71 new stores for the year. Finally, we expanded 16 high-performing stores and closed 15 under-performing stores for net growth of 56 stores for the year. As a result, our chain stood at a total of 1,044 stores at year’s end, spanning 33 states. Looking ahead, we expect to assume a slightly more conservative posture regarding site selection and expansion, and as a result, we are targeting the opening of approximately 40 to 50 net new stores during Fiscal 2017 – or more depending on the opportunities that come our way. Our primary goal is to ensure that we are opening good, quality stores that can execute well on our strategies. We still feel very conﬁdent that we can expand to more than 1,500 stores over time. As mentioned at the outset, we are pleased with the progress being made with many of our key initiatives. Foremost among these is our omni-channel initiative, which throughout the year came increasingly in focus as greater visibility on requirements, components and timelines emerged. Phase one of this initiative, which is expected to be operational in the third quarter of Fiscal 2017, will be the rollout of our new point-of-sale system. This will provide inventory visibility across the chain, and will facilitate store- to-store transfers in order to complete a customer sale. This phase will also include a new customer relationship management capability, which will allow us to more eƯectively communicate and market to our database of more than ﬁve million MVP loyalty members. Phase two, which will allow us to use our chain-wide inventory for a store-to- home shipping capability, is expected to be in pilot by the end of Fiscal 2017. Phase three, which is expected to launch in the back half of Fiscal 2018, will enable digital commerce and, once implemented, will be fully integrated with our brick-and-mortar stores to provide a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. Moving forward with this initiative, we recently announced that Bill Quinn has joined the Company as Vice President of Digital Commerce. Bill has approximately 20 years of diverse work experience including digital, marketing, merchandising, sales, customer service, and process improvement. In addition, he brings more than 11 years of experience in growing omni-channel businesses across a wide variety of industries and platforms. As a brand, Hibbett Sports continues to focus on a reﬁned and premium o Ưering of footwear, apparel and equipment that meets the needs of our customers. We salute our vendor partners, like Nike, Under Armour, Adidas and others, who continue to support us in our e Ưorts to bring premium products, backed by convenient locations and unmatched customer service, to more than a thousand communities across most of the United States. At Hibbett Sports, we don’t just proclaim a corporate slogan, “A Constant State of Game,” we live it every day, as do the more than 8,000 employees in our stores, wholesale and logistics facility, and store support center. Their success drives our success. On behalf of the Board of Directors, management and our employees, please know that your continued support and investment with us are greatly appreciated. Sincerely, JeƯry O. Rosenthal Chief Executive O Ưicer and President ",
                  "During the past year, the retail industry continued to evolve due to shifts in consumer preferences, product trends, and shopping preferences by channel. We continue to be focused on adapting to these changing trends and feel that our strategy is aligned to capitalize on these opportunities in the future. One of the most important components of this strategy is our omni-channel initiative, which will eventually give our customers the ﬂexibility to shop when and how they want while providing them excellent customer service. We made signiﬁcant progress on this initiative in Fiscal 2017 and are excited about the upcoming launch of our e-commerce website later this year. Along with our omni-channel capability, we are seeing some signiﬁcant beneﬁts from our store-typing initiative. We continue to reﬁne our store assortments according to the preferences of our local customer base and are fully aligned with our key vendors to provide the merchandise that is in high demand for our customers. Our early positive results from this initiative give us conﬁdence as we continue these enhancements across the chain. Overall, we experienced weaker results for Fiscal 2017 as total sales increased 3% to $973 million and comparable store sales increased 0.2%. These sales results, along with our continued investments in our omni-channel strategy, led to lower earnings for the year as earnings per diluted share declined 7% to $2.72. At the end of Fiscal 2017, available cash and cash equivalents rose to $39 million from $32 million last year, and we again ended the year with no outstanding bank debt and full availability of our $80 million revolving credit facilities. This balance sheet strength provides Hibbett Sports with crucial ﬁnancial ﬂexibility as we continue to grow our chain, make investments to transform our business, and support a signiﬁcant and ongoing share repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock for $43 million. As of our most recent ﬁscal year end, we had approximately $258 million remaining under the existing repurchase authorization for future stock repurchases. As you may recall from last year’s letter, our omni-channel initiative is set to fundamentally change the way we interface with our customers and leverage the existing capabilities of our brick-and-mortar stores and logistics facility. The ﬁrst phase of this initiative, which involved the implementation of a new point-of-sale system, was to help ensure we could satisfy the needs of our customers shopping in our stores. This phase is virtually complete and will connect our stores in a way that gives them access to inventory across our entire chain. This means that if a store does not have a particular size or style of an item desired by a customer, store personnel can locate the item in another store and have it sent directly to the customer’s home. Additionally, we plan to launch our e-commerce site in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, which will be fully integrated with our stores. A customer will be able to shop online, see inventory availability in our stores, return online purchases to stores, and have seamless access to our customer loyalty program. Once implemented, we feel this initiative will provide a platform to ensure an outstanding customer experience regardless of channel. We are also in the process of enhancing our customer loyalty program, allowing customers to achieve rewards at a faster rate and establishing an additional tier with enhanced beneﬁts for our most frequent customers. One of our other major initiatives, store-typing, should continue to deliver beneﬁts in Fiscal 2018 as we reﬁne this strategy and make the needed merchandising adjustments in our stores. By typing a store as either fashion specialty, athletic specialty or sport specialty, we adjust the penetration of our merchandise categories to better align with local customer needs. All categories remain important to our business, but this strategy helps us ensure that selling space and assortments are better matched to demand. For Fiscal 2017, we experienced some early success in categories such as lifestyle footwear and fashion apparel, and we look forward to even more opportunities in Fiscal 2018. Along with our major initiatives, we continue to see signiﬁcant opportunity to expand our small-box strategy across the country in underserved markets. As an example, we recently opened our ﬁrst three stores in relatively remote areas of California and are seeing very encouraging results so far. We believe this state will provide signiﬁcant expansion prospects in the future, along with many other opportunities in other states and in our existing geography. Our compelling line-up of fresh and innovative merchandise from leading brands helps us diƯerentiate ourselves from the competition, and our strong vendor partnerships continue to provide us access to new, trend-relevant merchandise for our stores. During Fiscal 2017, we opened 65 new stores and closed 31 underperforming stores, resulting in a net growth of 34 locations. This was in line with our previously expressed intention to become somewhat more conservative regarding site selection and expansion to ensure that new locations are positioned to execute well on our strategies. These new stores expanded our footprint to 1,078 locations across 35 states, including initial entry into Wyoming and California. We also expanded eight high-performing stores during the year. In Fiscal 2018, we plan to open approximately 50-60 new stores and close 25 to 35 existing stores. Over time, our goal remains to have at least 1,500 stores across the country. In closing, let me reiterate the conﬁdence we have in our business and strategic direction. I believe the coming year will begin to reveal the importance and value of the signiﬁcant investments we have made over the past several years – a new logistics facility, a new home o Ưice, various major system upgrades, a new POS system, and a fully integrated omnichannel platform. All of these investments were made to ensure our continued success in the future and to provide a best-in-class shopping experience for our customers. I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work in helping customers every day in our stores and for bringing our longterm vision to a reality. As always, we thank you for your continued support for the Company. All of us at Hibbett Sports appreciate your ongoing conﬁdence as we strive to enhance shareholder value. Sincerely, JeƯry O.

                  "HMSY",
                  "Dear Shareholder, Expenditures in the U.S. healthcare system continue to grow at an unsustainable pace. Containing costs by correcting billing and payment errors, estimated at close to $170 billion in 2015, is one of the most important means available for impacting those costs. Against that backdrop, we saved billions of dollars last year for our customers and identiﬁed billions more in cost avoidance opportunities. 2015 was also a year of solid revenue growth, strong cash ﬂow, improved e Ưiciency and increased proﬁtability at HMS. We began last year with 40% of our state Medicaid TPL revenue scheduled for rebid, an ambitious goal of increasing our commercial health plan revenue by 20% and uncertainty about when new Medicare RAC contracts would be awarded. We ended 2015 with our historically strong state Medicaid TPL presence solidly in place, our health plan growth goal achieved and the future of the Medicare RAC program still unsettled. Entering 2016, we have multi-year contractual relationships in place serving state Medicaid programs in 45 states and the District of Columbia. With an excellent record of retention for over 30 years, that business should be a steady component of our annual revenue and proﬁtability long into the future. Our current growth engine, however, is the commercial health plan business for which 2015 was a breakout year. As health plans continue to place trust in HMS for their cost containment solutions, we added a dozen new customers last year and now work with over 250 plans nationally. We also increased our customer base by 2.5 million unique lives, taking the total to more than 85 million, and we sold incremental products to current customers covering approximately 12.6 million of those lives. We expect 2016 health plan revenue growth of 18-20%, placing it on a trajectory to surpass the state government revenue for the ﬁrst time in Company history. Data we maintain for our customers gives us unparalleled access to a Medicaid database we believe is the largest in the nation. The depth, breadth and multiyear history of that data contributes signiﬁcantly to the sophistication of our proprietary matching algorithms and clinical analytics. Our extensive customer base also provides a powerful distribution channel for new products, such as the prepay clinical claim review solution we launched last July. Several factors give us conﬁdence that we can achieve our targeted health plan growth for 2016. In addition to internal steps we took last year to increase e Ưiciency, in terms of the implementation of new business and the proﬁt yield on existing sales, there are two powerful macro forces creating a tailwind. The AƯordable Care Act continues to boost annual Medicaid enrollment and spending, and an estimated 10,000 aging baby boomers are entering Medicare each day. Most new enrollees are joining Medicare Advantage plans – a growing market opportunity for HMS. In addition to these demographics, structural changes in the healthcare delivery landscape are presenting added opportunities to sell our products and services to payers. The increasing complexity of payment models, including the gradual move toward pay-for-performance, is making payment accuracy more of a focus. High cost Health Exchange members are creating a sense of urgency among payers to ﬁnd new ways to control costs. Finally, we see evidence that the frequency and magnitude of high proﬁle healthcare data breaches are pushing health plans in the direction of sharing their members’ personal health information with fewer trusted partners – and making sure those few meet high data security standards. All of these factors combined play to our strengths, as many of our customers seek to consolidate their business among fewer and more substantial service providers. In addition to achieving signiﬁcant revenue growth and improved proﬁtability, our balance sheet strengthened throughout 2015. We ended the year with $146 million in cash, even after purchasing $50 million of our shares pursuant to a Board authorized buyback program. Our purchase of approximately4.7 million HMSY shares during the second half reduced the year-end share count by nearly 4.5%. We anticipate continued strong operating cash ﬂow in 2016, on the order of $20-25 million per quarter and capital expenditures for the full year of approximately $20 million. Those capital investments will be focused primarily on IT infrastructure improvements, product enhancements and new product development. Our strong balance sheet gives us the ﬂexibility to make an acquisition that leverages our large installed customer base and complements our core competencies, expands our data analytics capabilities, and/or supplements our capacity to identify and reduce fraud, waste and abuse. Strategically, we are intensifying our focus on the identiﬁcation of opportunities for new products and new business relationships as growing attention is paid to population health management, member health and risk analytics. We have an internal innovation team exploring how our massive eligibility and paid claims database, sophisticated data analytics capacity and uniquely broad distribution channel may position us to play in each of those arenas. Data sharing among payers presents another opportunity for HMS, as we expect there will be growing interest in developing applications to look across entire populations in a given geography. Identifying and eliminating fraud, for example, is one of the most obvious areas for cooperation among health plan and government payers. The Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership, led by CMS, is a voluntary public- private eƯort among federal and state government o Ưicials, law enforcement, commercial health plans and healthcare antifraud associations. HMS is proud to have been selected last year as a “trusted third party” participant in the group’s activities, which are focused on the detection and prevention of healthcare fraud through data and information sharing and analytics. At HMS, we are in the enviable position of selling our services in a healthcare market where the opportunity to address payment errors is virtually unlimited and growing annually, due to increases in the number of insured lives and healthcare expenditures which continue to rise unabated. Our consistent performance for customers over the years has positioned HMS as a market-leading data analytics company. With ROIs of 10 to 1 and higher, we have a proven record of helping our customers reduce erroneous payments and thereby bend the healthcare cost curve. We approach 2016 with renewed conﬁdence in our business model, strategic priorities, ﬁnancial strength, dedicated employees and experienced executive team. We also remain ﬁrmly committed to maximizing shareholder value. Thank you for your support and conﬁdence. William C.

                  "Dear Shareholder, 2016 was a year of solid growth in total revenue and earnings per share. Adjusted EBITDA also increased, overall proﬁtability and margins improved, and operating cash ﬂow remained strong. In addition, we achieved a key strategic objective for the year by acquiring a care management platform. Beyond our ﬁnancial performance, we are proud to have saved billions of dollars for our customers. Those savings represent an important contribution to bending the ever-rising healthcare cost curve in this nation. Our 2016 commercial health plan revenue exceeded our state government revenue for the ﬁrst time and signiﬁcant sales throughoutlast year form the foundation for strong commercial revenue growth we expect again in 2017. We added over 17 million new commercial lives, including a sale in the second quarter to a single customer for 15 million of their at-risk and ASO members, taking our commercial health plan lives over 100 million. We also sold additional products to existing health plan customers last year covering approximately 30 million of their members, compared to about 13 million in the prior year. Full-year adjusted earnings per share were up 30% in 2016. Operating cash ﬂow increased 22% and year-end cash of $176 million was 21% higher than the prior year-end, even after the $21 million purchase of Essette in the third quarter and $20 million of share repurchases (1.1 million shares) in the fourth quarter. Through year end we had purchased a total of 5.9 million shares at an average price of $11.95 per share pursuant to a buyback plan instituted by our Board in August of 2015. We also completed a tax project in the third quarter – identifying certain credits and deductions that reduced our annual e Ưective tax rate by 300 bps to ~37%. The Essette care management platform, acquired last fall, was the foundation for a new third business vertical, which was strengthened considerably by the acquisition of the Eliza Corporation consumer engagement platform completed in April of this year. Essette was designed and built from the ground up to serve as a “care tra Ưic controller” – helping risk bearing entities identify and manage at-risk populations. Eliza is a cloud-based technology platform which provides comprehensive and personalized health engagement solutions designed to improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs by motivating members to adopt targeted behaviors. Eliza has developed sophisticated communication techniques - based on proprietary patented predictive analytics, behavioral science and digital design techniques - to eƯectively engage members and achieve better health outcomes. We see these Essette and Eliza capabilities as a natural extension of the cost containment solutions we have o Ưered historically, an opportunity to further leverage our data assets, and a strategic response to the need for payers to improve health outcomes and reduce costs for their highest risk members. We believe there will be signiﬁcant opportunities to cross-sell our new care management and member engagement solutions to our health plan and state government customers. meaningful growth opportunities for our suite of cost containment solutions. We currently face some uncertainty as Congress and the Trump Administration consider various approaches to the focused on preserving the dollars they receive than they are today. William C.

                  "Dear Shareholder, The healthcare industry is increasingly focused on enhancing the consumer experience and improving health outcomes by better engaging individuals in managing their own health. To capitalize on this trend, we completed an important strategic acquisition of Eliza Holding Corp. (“Eliza”) in April 2017. Together with the 2016 purchase of the Essette care management platform, HMS now oƯers a signiﬁcantly expanded suite of solutions to engage consumers and better manage their care. With our new care management and consumer engagement vertical, combined with our heritage cost- containment businesses, HMS can address virtually every aspect of the estimated $1 trillion in annual U.S. healthcare spend lost to fraud, waste and abuse. As a result, we are a key partner for payers seeking to proactively manage the health of their members and to bend the unsustainable upward trajectory of the healthcare cost curve. Eliza is a cloud-based technology platform that provides personalized health engagement solutions – at scale – to improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs by motivating members to adopt targeted behaviors. It creates expanded opportunities to leverage our three principal assets – data, analytics and an expansive customer base – and to partner with payers as they develop and execute strategies to become more consumer- centric. We also believe our new o Ưerings will increase member satisfaction and retention rates, while positioning HMS to address other factors a Ưecting healthcare, such as the increasing inﬂuence of artiﬁcial intelligence; a greater focus on price transparency; heightened recognition of the impact of social determinants; and the growing role of big data and technology-based analytics. Eliza can, for example, identify social determinants during member outreach or health risk assessment activities and provide actionable insights to customers, so they can direct their members to appropriate assistance and care. This is important because socioeconomics, education levels, employment status and social networks are factors that signiﬁcantly impact overall health but cannot be assessed from an enrollment ﬁle or medical claim. Our 2017 ﬁnancial performance included record full year coordination of beneﬁts revenue, which was up more than 8% compared to the prior year; full year total company revenue which topped $500 million for the ﬁrst time in our history; and continued strong operating cash ﬂow. Execution challenges kept us from reaching our payment integrity (“PI”) revenue target for the year, but we made substantial progress on several initiatives we believe can drive double-digit growth for our PI business in the year ahead. Throughout 2017, we made investments in people, technology, process improvements and innovation to accelerate the growth we believe is inherent in our business model. We began to see the expected payback in the fourth quarter, and plan to continue investing in our IT infrastructure and expanding our big data environment in 2018. Beyond investing in growth, our priority this year is to deploy capital for acquisitions that complement our core business, broaden our data analytics capabilities or add to our capacity to detect fraud, waste and abuse. We will stay disciplined in reviewing such opportunities and continue to apply rigorous diligence standards as we consider any future purchases. We also have a $50 million share buyback program in place, with $14 million used in the fourth quarter of 2017, which we will deploy opportunistically. Our balance sheet remains strong, with low leverage and a newly amended and extended $500 million credit facility, ﬁnalized last December which increases ﬂexibility and supplements our strong operating cash ﬂow. Our outlook for 2018 includes total company revenue growth of 7-9% and margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points. We will continue to prudently manage operating expenses and anticipate capital expenditures will be roughly ﬂat compared to 2017. Our e Ưective tax rate is expected to be below 30%, as a result of the federal legislation signed into law last December. We plan to reduce the inventory of sold but not implemented business over the course of 2018 as we work through a backlog that grew throughout last year. We also took a number of steps in 2017 to improve the implementation process and will continue to focus this year on reducing the time it takes to produce the ﬁrst dollars of revenue – particularly in our PI business. Our strategic priorities for 2018 are designed to maximize total shareholder return and include the following: Boost organic revenue growth across all of our products Utilize technology, innovation and our scalable business model to expand margins Maximize cross sales of our care management and consumer engagement solutions to existing customers Leverage technology to further strengthen the value of our vast healthcare database and sophisticated analytics Seek to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction and HMS employee engagement We approach 2018 with enthusiasm and conﬁdence in our ability to show year-over-year improvement on a number of key ﬁnancial measures, and to continue positioning HMS for long-term revenue growth and enhanced proﬁtability.

                  "JPM",
                  "FICO 2 Dear Fellow Shareholders, Last year — in fact, the last decade — was an extraordinary time for our company. We managed through the ﬁnancial crisis and its turbulent aftermath while never losing sight of the reason we are here: to serve our clients, our communities and countries across the globe and, of course, to earn a fair proﬁt for our shareholders. All the while, we have been successfully executing our control and regulatory agenda and continuing to invest in technology, infrastructure and talent — critical to the future of the company. And each year, our company has been getting safer and stronger. We continue to see exciting opportunities to invest for the future and to do more for our clients and our communities — as well as continue to support the growth of economies around the world. I feel enormously blessed to work for this great company and with such talented employees. Our management team and employees have built an exceptional organization that is one of the most trusted and respected ﬁnancial institutions in the world. It has been their dedication, fortitude and perseverance that made this possible. And it ﬁlls me with tremendous pride. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive O Ưicer 3 Our company earned a record $24.4 billion in net income on revenue of $96.6 billion in 2015. In fact, we have delivered record results in the last ﬁve out of six years, and we hope to continue to deliver in the future. Our ﬁnancial results reﬂected strong underlying performance across our businesses, and, importantly, we exceeded all our major ﬁnancial commitments — balance sheet optimization, capital deployment, global systemically important bank (GSIB) surcharge reduction and expense cuts. Earnings, Diluted Earnings per Share and Return on Tangible Common Equity 2004—2015 ($ in billions, except per share and ratio data) While we did produce record proﬁts last year, our returns on tangible common equity have been coming down, mostly due to higher capital requirements, higher control costs and low interest rates. Our return on tangible common equity was 13% last year, though we still believe that we will be able to achieve, over time, returns of approximately 15%. We still don’t know the ﬁnal capital rules, which could have additional negative e Ưects, but we do believe that the capital requirements eventually will be oƯset by optimizing our use of capital and other precious resources, by realizing market share gains due to some competitors leaving certain businesses, and by implementing extensive cost e Ưiciencies created by streamlining and digitizing our processes. I will discuss some of these e Ưorts later on in this letter.             2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 $4.5 $1.52 $8.5 $2.35 $14.4 $4.00 $15.4 $4.33 $5.6 $1.35 $11.7 $2.26 $17.4 $3.96 $19.0 $4.48 $21.3 $5.19 $17.9 $4.34 $21.7 $5.29 $24.4 $6.00 Earnings, Diluted Earnings per Share and Return on Tangible Common Equity 2004 –2015 (in billions, except per share and ratio data)  Net income  Diluted earnings per share  Return on tangible common equity 10% 15% 24% 22%             6% 10% 15% 15% 15% 11% 13% 13% 4 We continued to deliver for our shareholders in 2015. The table above shows the growth in tangible book value per share, which we believe is a conservative measure of value. You can see that our tangible book value per share has grown far more than that of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) in both time periods. For Bank One shareholders since March 27, 2000, the stock has performed far better than most ﬁnancial companies and the S&P 500. We are not proud of the fact that our stock performance has only equaled the S&P 500 since the JPMorgan Chase & Co. merger with Bank One on July 1, 2004 and essentially over the last ﬁve to 10 years. On a relative basis, though, JPMorgan Chase stock has far outperformed the S&P Financials Index and, in fact, has been one of the best performers of all banks during this di Ưicult period. The details are shown on the table on the following page. 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 $15.35 $16.45 $18.88 $21.96 $22.52 $27.09 $30.12 $33.62 $38.68 $40.72 $44.60 $48.13 Tangible Book Value per Share 2004–2015 Tangible Book Value per Share 2004— 2015 Bank One/JPMorgan Chase & Co. tangible book value per share performance vs. S&P 500 Bank One (A) S&P 500 (B) Relative Results (A) — (B) Performance since becoming CEO of Bank One (3/27/2000—12/31/2015)1 Compounded annual gain 12.5% 5.0% 7.5% Overall gain 481.4% 107.9% 373.5% JPMorgan Chase & Co.

In this chart, we are looking at heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share; it is an aftertax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number with dividends reinvested. 1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One. 5 Many of the legal and regulatory issues that our company and the industry have faced since the Great Recession have been resolved or are receding, which will allow the strength and quality of our underlying business to more fully shine through. In this letter, I will discuss the issues highlighted below — which describe many of our successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses. The main sections are listed below, and, unlike prior years, we have organized much of this letter around some of the key questions we have received from shareholders and other interested parties.

In fact, most cities, states and countries want more of JPMorgan Chase. They want us to bring more of our resources – our ﬁnancial capabilities and technology, as well as our human capital and expertise – to their communities. While we do not know what the next few years may bring, we are conﬁdent that the needs of our clients around the world will continue to grow and that our consistent strategy of building for the future and being there for our clients in good times and bad has put us in very good stead. Whatever the future brings, we will face it from a position of strength and stability. Because our business leaders do such a good job describing their businesses (and I strongly urge you to read their letters on pages 52– 72 in this Annual Report), it is unnecessary for me to cover each in detail here, other than to answer the following critical questions. I.

JPM overhead ratio represents the sum of the implied expenses of all peers and JPM Corporate segment divided by JPM revenue. 3 CIB ROE excluding legal expense was 14%. 4 Represents ﬁrmwide ROTCE for JPM. Goodwill is primarily related to the Bank One merger and prior acquisitions and is predominantly retained by Corporate. 5 Best-in-class ROTCE represents implied net income minus preferred stock dividends (NIAC) for each comparable LOB peer weighted by JPM average tangible common equity: WFC, Citi Institutional Clients Group (Citi), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Bank of America Global Wealth and Investment Management (BAC), T. Rowe Price (TROW). JPM ROTCE represents the sum of the implied combined NIAC of all peers and JPM Corporate segment divided by JPM average tangible equity. JPMorgan Chase is in Line with Best-in-Class Peers in Both EƯiciency and Returns 9 Virtually all of our businesses are close to best in class, in overhead ratios and, more important, in return on equity (ROE), as shown on the chart on page 8. Of even more relevance, we have these strong ratios while making sizable investments for the future (which we have reported on extensively in the past and you can read more about in the CEO letters). It is easy to meet short-term targets by skimping on investments for the future, but that is not our approach for building the business for the long term. How do you compare your franchises with your peers? What makes you believe your businesses are strong? We are deeply aware that our clients choose who they want to do business with each and every day, and we are gratiﬁed that we continue to earn our clients’ business and their trust. If you are gaining customers and market share, you have to be doing something right. The chart below shows that we have been meeting this goal fairly consistently for 10 years.

In addition, our Commercial Banking satisfaction score is among the highest in the industry in terms of customer loyalty. In Asset Management, where customers vote with their wallet, JPMorgan Funds ﬁnished second in long-term net ﬂows among all fund complexes. Later on in this letter, I will describe our fortress balance sheet and controls, as well as the discipline we have around risk management. I will also talk more about our employees, some exciting new opportunities – mostly driven by innovative technologies – and our ongoing support for our communities and our country. It is critical that we do all of these things right to maintain the strength of our company. 1 Source: J.D.

We have taken many actions that should give our shareholders, clients and regulators comfort and demonstrate that our company is rock solid. The actions we have taken to strengthen our company. In this section, we describe the many actions that we have taken to make our company stronger and safer: our fortress balance sheet with enhanced capital and liquidity, our ability to survive extreme stress of multiple types, our extensive de-risking and simpliﬁcation of the business, and the building of fortress controls in meeting far more stringent regulatory standards. Taken together, these actions have enabled us to make extraordinary progress toward reducing and ultimately eliminating the risk of JPMorgan Chase failing and the cost of any failure being borne by the American taxpayer or the U.S. economy. II. WE MUST AND WILL PROTECT OUR COMPANY AND THOSE WE SERVE You say you have a “fortress balance sheet.” What does that mean? Can you handle the extreme stress that seems to happen around the world from time to time? Nearly every year since the Great Recession, we have improved virtually every measure of ﬁnancial strength, including many new ones. It’s important to note as a starting point that in the worst years of 2008 and 2009, JPMorgan Chase did absolutely ﬁne – we never lost money, we continued to serve our clients, and we had the wherewithal and capability to buy and integrate Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. That said, we nonetheless recognize that many Americans did not do ﬁne, and the ﬁnancial crisis exposed weaknesses in the mortgage market and other areas. Later in this letter, I will also describe what we are doing to strengthen JPMorgan Chase and to help support the entire economy. The chart on page 12 shows many of the measures of our ﬁnancial strength – both from the year preceding the crisis and our improvement in the last year alone. In addition, every year, the Federal Reserve puts all large banks through a very severe and very detailed stress test. Among other things, last year’s stress test assumed that unemployment would go to 10.1%, housing prices would fall 25%, equity markets would decline by nearly 60%, real gross domestic product (GDP) would decline 4.6%, credit spreads would widen dramatically and oil prices would rise to $110 per barrel. The stress test also assumed an instantaneous global market shock, e Ưectively far worse than the one that happened in 2009, causing large trading losses. It also assumed the failure of the largest counterparty (this is meant to capture the failure of the global bank that you have the most extensive derivative relationship with; e.g., a Lehman-type event), which would cause additional losses. The stress test assumed that banks would not stop buying back stock – therefore depleting their capital – and would continue to grow dramatically. (Of course, growing dramatically and buying back stock if your bank were under stress would be irresponsible – and is something we would never do.) Under this assumed stress, the Federal Reserve estimates that JPMorgan Chase would lose * Footnote: Our Chief Operating O Ưicer Matt Zames talks in his letter on pages 52–55 about many important initiatives to protect our company, including our physical security and cybersecurity, so I will not duplicate any of that information. 12 $55 billion pre-tax over a nine-quarter period, an amount that we would easily manage because of the strength of our capital base. Remember, the Federal Reserve stress test is not a forecast – it appropriately assumes multiple levels of conservatism and that very little mitigating action can be taken. However, we believe that if the stress scenario actually happened, we would incur minimal losses over a cumulative ninequarter period because of the extensive mitigating actions that we would take. It bears repeating that in the actual Great Recession, which was not unlike last year’s stress test, JPMorgan Chase never lost money in any quarter and was quite proﬁtable over the nine-quarter period. The stress test is extremely severe on credit. The 2015 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), or stress test, projected credit losses over a nine-quarter period that totaled approximately $50 billion for JPMorgan Chase, or 6.4% of all our loans.

The 2015 CCAR losses were even with the actual losses for banks during the worst two years of the Great Depression in the 1930s (6.4%). The stress test is extremely severe on trading and counterparty risk. Our 2015 CCAR trading and counterparty losses were $24 billion. We have two comparisons that should give comfort that our losses would never be this large. First, recall what actually happened to us in 2008. In the worst quarter of 2008, we lost $1.7 billion; for the entire year, we made $6.3 billion in trading revenue in the Investment Bank, which included some modest losses on the Lehman default (one of our largest counterparties). The trading books are much more conservative today than they were in 2008, and at that time, we were still paying a considerable cost for assimilating and de-risking Bear Stearns. Second, we run hundreds of stress tests of our own each week, across our global trading operations, to ensure our ability to withstand and survive many bad and extreme scenarios. These scenarios include events such as what happened in 2008, other historically damaging events and also new situations that might occur. We manage our company so that even under the worst market stress test conditions, we would almost never bear a loss of more than $5 billion (remember, we earn approximately $10 billion pre-tax, pre-provision each quarter). We recognize that on rare occasions, we could experience a negative signiﬁcant event that could lead to our having a poor quarter. But we will be vigilant and will never take such a high degree of risk that it jeopardizes the health of our company and our ability to continue to serve our clients. This is a bedrock principle. Later in this letter, I will also describe how we think about idiosyncratic geopolitical risk. And the capital we have to bear losses is enormous. We have an extraordinary amount of capital to sustain us in the event of losses. It is instructive to compare assumed extreme losses against how much capital we have for this purpose. You can see in the table below that JPMorgan Chase alone has enough loss absorbing resources to bear all the losses, assumed by CCAR, of the 31 largest banks in the United States. Because of regulations and higher capital, large banks in the United States are far stronger. And even if any one bank might fail, in my opinion, there is virtually no chance of a domino e Ưect. Our shareholders should understand that while large banks do signiﬁcant business with each other, they do not directly extend much credit to one other. And when they trade derivatives, they marktomarket and post collateral to each other every day.

Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding. 14 Do you think you now have “fortress controls” in place? We are good and are getting better. The intense e Ưorts over the last few years across our operating businesses – Risk, Finance, Compliance, Legal and Audit – are now yielding real results that will protect the company in the future. We have reinforced a culture of accountability for assuming risk and have come a long way in self-identifying and ﬁxing shortcomings. Many new permanent organizational structures have been put in place to ensure constant review and continuous improvement. For example, we now have a permanent Oversight & Control Group. The group is charged with enhancing the ﬁrm’s control environment by looking within and across the lines of business and corporate functions to identify and remediate control issues. This function enables us to detect control problems more quickly, escalate issues promptly and engage other stakeholders to understand However, we are going to be extremely vigilant to do more de-risking if we believe that something creates additional legal, regulatory or political risks. We regularly review all our business activities and try to exceed – not just meet – regulatory demands. We also now ask our Legal Department to be on the search for “emerging legal risks.” We try to think diƯerently; for example, we try to look at legal risks not based on how the law is today but based on how the law might be interpreted di Ưerently 10 years from now. It is perfectly reasonable for the legal and regulaHave you completed your major de-risking initiatives? Yes, we have completed our major de-risking initiatives, and some were pretty draconian. In the chart below, I show just a few of the actions that we were willing to take to reduce various forms of risk: tory agencies to want to improve the quality of the businesses they oversee, particularly around important issues such as customer protection. We also expect this reﬁnement frequently will be achieved through enforcement actions as opposed to the adoption of new rules that raise standards. For many years, regulations generally were viewed as being static. As we do everywhere else, we should be striving for constant improvement to stay ahead of the curve.

We have strengthened the Audit Department and risk assessment throughout the ﬁrm, enhanced data quality and controls, and also strengthened permanent standing committees that review new clients, new products and all reputational issues. The e Ưort is enormous. Since 2011, our total headcount directly associated with Controls has gone from 24,000 people to 43,000 people, and our total annual Controls spend has gone from $6 billion to approximately $9 billion annually over that same time period. We have more work to do, but a strong and permanent foundation is in place. Far more is spent on Controls if you include the time and e Ưort expended by front -oƯice personnel, committees and reviews, as well as certain technology and operations functions. We have also made a very substantial amount of progress in Anti-Money Laundering/Bank Secrecy Act. We deployed a new anti-money laundering (AML) system, Mantas, which is a monitoring platform for all global payment transactions. It now is functioning across our company and utilizes sophisticated algorithms that are regularly enhanced based on transactional experience. We review electronically $105 trillion of gross payments each month, and then, on average, 55,000 transactions are reviewed by humans after algorithms identify any single transaction as a potential issue. Following this e Ưort, we stopped doing business with 18,000 customers in 2015. We also are required to ﬁle suspicious activity reports (SAR) with the government on any suspicious activity. Last year, we ﬁled 180,000 SARs, and we estimate that the industry as a whole ﬁles millions each year. We understand how important this activity is, not just to protect our company but to help protect our country from criminals and terrorists. We exited or restricted approximately 500 foreign correspondent banking relationships and tens of thousands of client relationships to simplify our business and to reduce our AML risk. The cost of doing proper AML/ KYC (Know Your Customer) diligence on a client increased dramatically, making many of these relationships immediately unproﬁtable. But we did not exit simply due to proﬁtability – we could have maintained unproﬁtable client relationships to be supportive of countries around the world that are allies to the United States. The real reason we exited was often because of the extraordinary legal risk if we were to make a mistake. In many of these places, it simply is impossible to meet the new requirements, and if you make just one mistake, the regulatory and legal consequences can be severe and disproportionate. We also remediated 130,000 accounts for KYC – across the Private Bank, Commercial Bank and the Corporate & Investment Bank. This exercise vastly improved our data, gave us far more information on our clients and also led to our exiting a small number of client relationships. We will be vigilant on onboarding and maintaining ﬁles on all new clients in order to stay as far away as we can from any client with unreasonable risk. In all cases, we carefully tried to get the balance right while treating customers fairly. You can see that we are doing everything in our power to meet and even exceed the spirit and the letter of the law to avoid making mistakes and the high cost – both monetarily and to our reputation – that comes with that. But we also tried to make sure that in our quest to eliminate risk, we did not ask a lot of good clients to exit. We hope that in the future, the regulatory response to any mistakes – if and when they happen, and they will happen – will take into account the extraordinary e Ưort to get it right. 16 many of the processes we implemented for CCAR and AML/KYC had to be done quickly, and many were e Ưectively handled outside our normal processes. Eventually, CCAR will be embedded into our normal forecasting and budgeting systems. And we are trying to build the data collection part of KYC into a utility that the entire industry can use – not just for us and our peer group but, equally important, for the client’s beneﬁt (the client would essentially only have to ﬁll out one form, which then could be used by all banks). In addition, throughout the company, continually creating straight-through processing, online client service and other initiatives will both improve the client experience and decrease our costs. What is all this talk of regulatory optimization, and don’t some of these things hurt clients? When will you know the ﬁnal rules? In the last year, we took some dramatic actions to reduce our GSIB capital surcharge, which we now have successfully reduced from 4.5% to an estimate of 3.5%. These steps included reducing non-operating deposits by approximately $200 billion, level 3 assets by $22 billion and notional derivatives amounts by $15 trillion. We did this faster than we, or anyone, thought we could. We still will be working to further reduce the GSIB surcharge, but any reduction from this point will take a few years. Like us, most banks are modifying their business models and client relationships to accomplish their regulatory objectives. We are doing this by managing our constraints at the most granular level possible – by product, client or business. Clearly, some of these constraints, including GSIB and CCAR, cannot be fully pushed down to the client. Importantly, we are focused on clientfriendly execution – and we recognize that these constraints are of no direct concern to clients. To protect the company and to meet standards of safety and soundness, don’t you have to earn a fair proﬁt? Many banks say that the cost of all the new rules makes this hard to do. Having enough capital and liquidity, and even the most solid fortress controls, doesn’t make you completely safe and sound. Delivering proper proﬁt margins and maintaining proﬁtability through a normal credit cycle also are important. A business does this by having the appropriate business mix, making good loans and managing expenses over time. Clearly, some of the new rules create expenses and burdens on our company. Some of these expenses will eventually be passed on to clients, but we have many ways to manage our expenses. Simplifying our business, streamlining our procedures, and automating and digitizing processes, some of which previously were being done e Ưectively by hand, all will bring relief. For example, In the new world, our company has approximately 20 new or signiﬁcantly enhanced balance sheet and liquidity-related regulatory requirements – the most critical ones are the GSIB capital surcharge, CCAR, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the Supplementary Leverage Ratio and Basel III capital. Banks must necessarily optimize across these constraints to be able to meet all their regulatory requirements and, importantly, earn a proﬁt. Every bank has a di Ưerent binding constraint, and, over time, that constraint may change. Currently, our overriding constraint is the GSIB capital surcharge. Our shareholders should bear in mind that the U.S. government requires a GSIB capital surcharge that is double that of our international competitors. And this additional charge may ultimately put some U.S. banks at a disadvantage vs. international competitors. This is one reason why we worked so hard to reduce the GSIB capital surcharge – we do not want to be an outlier in the long run because of it. 17 Unfortunately, some of the ﬁnal rules around capital are still not fully known at this time. There are still several new rules coming that also could impact our company – probably the most important to us is how the GSIB capital surcharge is incorporated into the CCAR stress test. To date, we have managed to what we do know. We believe that when the ﬁnal rules are made and known, we can adjust to them in an appropriate way. As banks change their business models to adapt to the new world, some are exiting certain products or regions. Market shares will change, and both products and product pricing will change over time. Therefore, we think there will be a lot of adjustments to make and tools to deploy so that we can still serve our clients and earn a fair proﬁt. We operate in more than 100 countries across the globe – and we are constantly analyzing the geopolitical and country risks that we face. The reason we operate in all these countries is not simply because they represent new markets where we can sell our products. When we operate in a country, we serve not only local institutions (governments and sovereign institutions, banks and corporations in that country) but also some of those institutions and corporations outside their country, along with multinationals when they enter that country. This creates a huge network e Ưect. In all the countries where we operate, approximately 40% of the business is indigenous, 30% is outbound and 30% is inbound. All these institutions need ﬁnancing and advice (M&A, equity, debt and loans), risk management (foreign exchange and interest rates) and asset management services (ﬁnancial planning and investment management), as well as operating services (custody and cash management) in their own countries and globally. It takes decades to build these capabilities and relationships – we cannot go in and out of a country on a whim, based on a short-term feeling about risk in that country. Therefore, we need plans for the long term while carefully managing current risk. We carefully monitor risks — country by country. For each country, we take a long-term view of its growth potential across all our lines of business. Each country is di Ưerent, but, for the most part, emerging and developing markets will grow faster than developed countries. And as they grow, the need for our services grows dramatically. While we have a future growth plan for each country, we obviously can’t know with any certainty everything that will happen or the timing of recessions. No matter what the future brings, we make sure that we can easily bear the losses if we are wrong in our assessments. For each material country, we look at what our losses would be under severe stress (not that di Ưerent from the Fed’s CCAR stress test). We manage so that should the extreme situation occur, we might lose money, but we could easily handle the result. Below are a few examples of how we manage risk while continuing to serve clients in speciﬁc countries. China. We believe it likely that, in 20–25 years, China will be a developed nation, probably housing 25% or more of the top 3,000 companies globally. Going forward, we do not expect China to enjoy the smooth, steady growth it has had over the past 20 years. Reforming ine Ưicient state-owned enterprises, developing healthy markets (like we have in the United States) with full transparency and creating a convertible currency where capital can move freely will not be easy. There will be many bumps in the road. We publicly disclose in our Form 10-K that we have approximately $19 billion of country exposure to China. We run China through a severe stress test (essentially, a major recession with massive defaults and trading losses), and we estimate that our losses in this scenario could be approximately $4 billion. We do not expect this situation to How do you manage geopolitical and country risks? 18 happen, but if it did, we could easily handle it. We manage our growth in China to try to capture the long-term value (and, remember, this will help a lot of our businesses outside of China, too) and in a way that would enable us to handle bad, unexpected outcomes. We don’t mind having a bad quarter or two, but we will not risk our company on any country. This is how we manage in all countries in which we have material activity. Brazil. Brazil has had a deteriorating economy, shrinking by 3%–4% over the last year. In addition, as I write this letter, Brazil faces political upheaval as its president is being threatened with impeachment and its former president is being indicted. Yet the country has a strong judicial system, many well-run companies, impressive universities, peaceful neighbors and an enormous quantity of natural resources. In Brazil, we have banking relationships with more than 2,000 clients, approximately 450 multinational corporations going into Brazil to do business and approximately 50 Brazilian companies going outbound. Our publicly disclosed exposure to Brazil is approximately $11 billion, but we think that in extreme stress, we might lose $2 billion. In each of the last three years, we actually have made money in Brazil. We are not retreating – because the long-term prospects are probably ﬁne – and for decades to come, Brazilians will appreciate our steadfastness when they most needed it. Argentina. Argentina is now a country with incredible opportunity. In the 1920s, its GDP per person was larger than that of France, whereas today, it is barely onethird compared with France. Argentina is an example of terrible public policy, often adopted under the auspices of being good for the people, that has resulted in extraordinary damage to the economy. However, the country has a highly educated population, a new president who is making bold and intelligent moves, peaceful neighbors and, like Brazil, an abundance of natural resources. You might be surprised to know that for the past 10 years, in spite of the country’s di Ưiculties, JPMorgan Chase has made a modest proﬁt there by consistently serving our clients and the country. This year, we took a little additional risk in Argentina with a special ﬁnancing to help bring the country some stability and help get it back into the global markets. We are hoping that Argentina can be an example to the world of what can happen when a country has a good leader who adopts good policy. To give you more comfort, I want to remind you that throughout all the international crises over the last decade, we maintained our businesses in many places that were under stress – such as Spain, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Portugal and Ireland. In almost every case, we did not have any material problems, and we are able to navigate every issue and continue to serve all our clients. Again, we hope this will put us in good stead in these countries for decades. Later in this letter, I will talk about another potentially serious issue – Britain possibly leaving the European Union. How do you manage your interest rate exposure? Are you worried about negative interest rates and the growing di Ưerences across countries? No, we are not worried about negative interest rates in the United States. For years, this country has had fairly consistent job growth and increasingly strong consumers (home prices are up, and the consumer balance sheet is in the best shape it’s ever been in). Housing is in short supply, and household formation is going up, car sales are at record levels, and we see that consumers are spending the gas dividend. Companies are ﬁnancially sound – while some segments’ proﬁts are down, companies have plenty of cash. Nor are we worried about the diverging interest rate policies around the world. While they are a reasonable cause for concern, it 19 is also natural that countries with di Ưerent growth rates and varying monetary and ﬁscal policies will have di Ưerent interest rates and currency movements. I am a little more concerned about the opposite: seeing interest rates rise faster than people expect. We hope rates will rise for a good reason; i.e., strong growth in the United States. Deﬂationary forces are receding – the deﬂationary e Ưects of a stronger U.S. dollar plus low commodity and oil prices will disappear. Wages appear to be going up, and China seems to be stabilizing. Finally, on a technical basis, the largest buyers of U.S. Treasuries since the Great Recession have been the U.S. Federal Reserve, countries adding to their foreign exchange reserve (such as China) and U.S. commercial banks (in order to meet liquidity requirements). These three buyers of U.S. Treasuries will not be there in the future. If we ever get a little more consumer and business conﬁdence, that would increase the demand for credit, as well as reduce the incentive and desire of certain investors to buy U.S. Treasuries because Treasuries are the “safe haven.” If this scenario were to happen with interest rates on 10-year Treasuries on the rise, the result is unlikely to be as smooth as we all might hope for. Are you worried about liquidity in the marketplace? What does it mean for JPMorgan Chase, its clients and the broader economy? It is good to have healthy markets – it sounds obvious, but it’s worth repeating. There are markets in virtually everything – from corn, soybeans and wheat to eggs, chicken and pork to cotton, commodities and even the weather. For some reason, the debate about having healthy ﬁnancial markets has become less civil and rational. Healthy ﬁnancial markets allow investors to buy cheaper and issuers to issue cheaper. It is important to have liquidity in di Ưicult times in the ﬁnancial markets because investors and corporations often have a greater and unexpected need for cash. Liquidity has gotten worse and we have seen extreme volatility and distortions in several markets. In the last year or two, we have seen extreme volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, the G10 foreign exchange markets and the U.S. equity markets. We have also seen more than normal volatility in global credit markets. These violent market swings are usually an indication of poor liquidity. Another peculiar event in the market is technical but important: U.S. Treasuries have been selling at a discount to their maturityrelated interest rate swaps. One of the surprises is that these markets are some of the most actively traded, liquid and standardized in the world. The good news is that the system is resilient enough to handle the volatility. The bad news is that we don’t completely understand why this is happening. There are multiple reasons why this volatility may be happening: • There are fewer market-makers in many markets. • Market-makers hold less inventory – probably due to the higher capital and liquidity required to be held against trading assets. • Smaller sizes of trades being o Ưered. It is true that the bid-ask spreads are still narrow but only if you are buying or selling a small amount of securities. • Lower availability and higher cost of securities ﬁnancing (securities ﬁnancing is very short-term borrowing, fully and safely collateralized by Treasuries and agency securities), which often is used for normal money market operations – movement of collateral, short-term money market investing and legitimate hedging activities. This is clearly due to the higher cost of capital and liquidity under the new capital rules. 20 We really need to be prepared for the e Ưects of illiquidity when we have bad markets. In bad markets, liquidity normally dries up a bit – the risk is that it will disappear more quickly. Many of the new rules are even more procyclical than they were in the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. In addition, psychologically, the Great Recession is still front and center in people’s minds, and the instinct to run for the exit may continue to be strong. The real risk is that high volatility, rapidly dropping prices, and the inability of certain investors and issuers to raise money may not be isolated to the ﬁnancial markets. These may feed back into the real economy as they did in 2008. The trading markets are adjusting to the new world. There are many non-bank participants that are starting to ﬁll in some of the gaps. Even corporations are holding more cash and liquidity to be more prepared for tough times. So this is something to keep an eye on – but not something to panic about. In a capitalistic and competitive system, we are completely supportive of competitors trying to ﬁll marketplace needs. One warning, however: Nonbank lenders that borrow from individuals and hedge funds or that rely on asset-backed securities will be unable to get all the funding they need in a crisis. This is not a systemic issue because they are still small in size, but it will a Ưect funding to individuals, small businesses and some middle market companies. JPMorgan Chase is well-positioned regardless. It is important for you to know that we are not overly worried about these issues for JPMorgan Chase. We always try to be prepared to handle violent markets. Our actual trading businesses are very strong (and it should give you some comfort to know that in all the trading days over the last three years, we only had losses on fewer than 20 days, which is extraordinary). Sometimes wider spreads actually help market-makers, and some repricing of balance sheet positions, like repo, already have helped the consistency of our results. As usual, we try to be there for our clients – in good times and, more important, in tough times. • Incomplete and sometimes confusing rules around securitizations and mortgages. We still have not ﬁnished all the rules around securitizations and in conjunction with far higher capital costs against certain types of securitizations. We have not had a healthy return to the securitization market. • The requirement to report all trades. This makes it much more di Ưicult to buy securities in quantity, particularly illiquid securities, because the whole world knows your positions. This has led to a greater discount for almost all o Ư-the-run securities (these are the securities of an issuer that are less regularly traded). • Possible structural issues; e.g., highfrequency trading. High-frequency trading usually takes place in small increments with most high-frequency traders beginning and ending the day with very little inventory. It appears that traders add liquidity during the day in liquid markets, but they mostly disappear in illiquid markets. (I should point out that many dealers also disappear in illiquid markets.) All trading positions have capital, liquidity, disclosure and Volcker Rule requirements – and they cause high GSIB capital surcharges and CCAR losses. It is virtually impossible to ﬁgure out the cumulative e Ưect of all the requirements or what contributes to what. In our opinion, lower liquidity and higher volatility are here to stay. One could reasonably argue that lower liquidity and higher volatility are not necessarily a bad thing. We may have had artiﬁcially higher liquidity in the past, and we are experiencing a return closer to normal. You certainly could argue that if this is a cost of a stronger ﬁnancial system, it is a reasonable tradeo Ư. Remember, the real cost is that purchasers and issuers of securities will, over time, simply pay more to buy or sell. In any event, lower liquidity and higher volatility are probably here to stay, and everyone will just have to learn to live with them. 21 We need to protect our customers, their data and our company. We necessarily have a huge amount of data about our customers because of underwriting, credit card transactions and other activities, and we use some of this data to help serve our customers better (I’ll speak more about big data later in this letter). And we do extensive work to protect our customers and their data – think cybersecurity, fraud protection, etc. We always start from the position that we want to be customer friendly. One item that I think warrants special attention is when our customers want to allow outside parties to have access to their bank accounts and their bank account information. Our customers have done this with payment companies, aggregators, ﬁnancial planners and others. We want to be helpful, but we have a responsibility to each of our customers, and we are extremely concerned. Let me explain why: • When we all readily click “I agree” online or on our mobile devices, allowing thirdparty access to our bank accounts and ﬁnancial information, it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that information might be used by a third party. We have analyzed many of the contracts of these third parties and have come to the following conclusions: – Far more information is taken than the third party needs in order to do its job. – Many third parties sell or trade information in a way customers may not understand, and the third parties, quite often, are doing it for their own economic beneﬁt – not for the customer’s beneﬁt. – Often this is being done on a daily basis for years after the customer signed up for the services, which they may no longer be using. We simply are asking third parties to limit themselves to what they need in order to serve the customer and to let the customer know exactly what information is being used and why and how. In the future, instead of giving a third party unlimited access to information in any bank account, we hope to build systems that allow us to “push” information – and only that information agreed to by the customer – to that third party. • Pushing speciﬁc information has another beneﬁt: Customers do not need to provide their bank passcode. When customers give out their bank passcode, they may not realize that if a rogue employee at an aggregator uses this passcode to steal money from the customer’s account, the customer, not the bank, is responsible for any loss. You can rest assured that when the bank is responsible for the loss, the customer will be fully reimbursed. That is not quite clear with many third parties. This lack of clarity and transparency isn’t fair or right. Privacy is of the utmost importance. We need to protect our customers and their data. We are now actively working with all third parties who are willing to work with us to set up data sharing the right way. Why are you making such a big deal about protecting customers’ data in your bank? 22 III. WE ACTIVELY DEVELOP AND SUPPORT OUR EMPLOYEES If you were able to travel the world with me, to virtually all major cities and countries, you would see ﬁrsthand your company in action and the high quality and character of our people. JPMorgan Chase and all its predecessor companies have prided themselves on doing “only ﬁrst-class business and in a ﬁrst-class way.” Much of the capability of this company resides in the knowledge, expertise and relationships of our people. And while we always try to bring in fresh talent and new perspectives, we are proud that our senior bankers have an average tenure of 15 years. This is testament to their experience, and it means they know who to call anywhere around the world to bring the full resources of JPMorgan Chase to bear for our clients. Traveling with me, you would see our senior leadership team’s exceptional character, culture and capability. You also would probably notice that 20% of this leadership group, over 250 teammates who manage our businesses worldwide, is ethnically diverse, and more than 30% are women. Even though we believe that we have excellent people and a strong, positive corporate culture, we are always examining new ways to improve. How are you ensuring you have the right conduct and culture? We reinforce our culture every chance we get. Our Business Principles are at the forefront of everything we do, and we need to make these principles part of every major conversation at the company – from the hiring, onboarding and training of new recruits to town halls and management meetings to how we reward and incentivize our people. To get better at this, last year we met with more than 16,000 employees in 1,400 focus groups around the world to get their feedback on some of our challenges and what we can do to strengthen and improve our culture. That said, we acknowledge that we, at times, have fallen short of the standards we have set for ourselves. This year, the company pleaded guilty to a single antitrust violation as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice related to foreign exchange activities. The conduct underlying the antitrust charge is principally attributable to a single trader (who has since been dismissed) and his coordination with traders at other ﬁrms. As we said at the time, one lesson is that the conduct of a small group of employees, or of even a single employee, can reﬂect badly on all of us and can have signiﬁcant ramiﬁcations for the entire ﬁrm. That’s why we must be ever vigilant in our commitment to fortify our controls and enhance our historically strong culture, continuing to underscore that doing the right thing is the responsibility of every employee at the company. We all have an obligation to treat our customers and clients fairly, to raise our hand when we see something wrong or to speak up about something that we should improve – rather than just complain about it or ignore it. We have intensiﬁed training and development. We are committed to properly training and developing our people to enable them to grow and succeed throughout their careers. Our intent is to create eƯective leaders who embody our Business Principles. 23 WE ARE HELPING OUR EMPLOYEES STAY HEALTHY For us, having healthy employees is about more than improving the ﬁrm’s bottom line; it’s about improving our employees’ lives — and sometimes even saving lives. In 2015, we estimate that our Health & Wellness Centers intervened in more than 100 potentially life-threatening situations (e.g., urgent cardiac or respiratory issues), and many more lives have been positively impacted by our numerous wellness initiatives. We believe that healthy employees are happy employees and that happy employees have more rewarding lives both inside and outside the o Ưice. Our commitment starts with o Ưering comprehensive beneﬁts programs and policies that support our employees and their families. To do this, JPMorgan Chase spent $1.1 billion in 2015 on medical beneﬁts for employees based in the United States, where our medical plan covers more than 190,000 employees, spouses and partners. We tier our insurance subsidies so our higher earners pay more, and our lower earners pay less — making coverage appropriately a Ưordable for all. We also contributed nearly $100 million in 2015 for employees’ Medical Reimbursement Accounts. And we have structured the plan in a way that preventative care and screenings are paid for by the company. Our beneﬁts o Ưering is supported by an extensive Wellness Program, which is designed to empower employees to take charge of their health. This includes health and wellness centers, health assessments and screenings, health advocates, employee assistance and emotional well-being programs, and physical activity events. In the ﬁrst year, only 36% of employees participated in health assessments and wellness screenings, but in 2015, 74% of our employees enrolled in the medical plan completed an assessment and screening. Last year, our on-site wellness screenings helped almost 14,000 employees detect a health risk or potentially serious condition and directed them to see a physician for follow-up. On another subject, we all know the value of eating lots of vegetables, so we’ve made it a priority to o Ưer an abundance of healthy meal and snack options in our on-site cafeterias and vending machines. One of the ﬂagships of our Wellness Program is our Health & Wellness Center network. Twentyseven of our 29 centers in the United States are sta Ưed with at least one doctor. Nearly half of our employees have access to a local center, and 56% of those with access walked in for a visit last year. These facilities are vitally important to our people. In 2015, these centers handled nearly 800 emergencies — including the 100 potentially lifesaving interventions, which I mentioned above. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle shouldn’t be a chore — it should be fun. Last year, we held our second StepUp challenge, a global competition that not only kept our employees active, it supported ﬁve charities that feed the hungry. More than 11,000 teams — a total of over 83,000 employees — added up their daily steps to take a virtual walk around the world. They began their journey in New York City and made virtual stops at seven of our o Ưice locations before ﬁnishing in Sydney. Together, they logged a total of 28.2 billion steps, which resulted in the ﬁrm donating more than $2 million to the ﬁve designated charities — enough to fund millions of meals around the world. 24 about business issues we have confronted and mistakes we have made. In its inaugural year, more than 4,500 managers attended programs with 156 sessions held at 20+ global locations. During 2016, over 13,000 managers are expected to attend. I personally take part in many of these sessions, which are now being held next to our New York City headquarters at The Pierpont Leadership Center, a state-of-the-art ﬂagship training center that opened in January 2016. JPMorgan Chase has 3,000 training programs, but we realized that we lacked a very important one: new manager development. Prior to 2015, when our employees became managers at the ﬁrm for the ﬁrst time, we basically left them on their own to ﬁgure out their new responsibilities. In 2015, we launched JPMorgan Chase’s Leadership Edge, a ﬁrmwide program to train leaders and develop management skills. These training programs inculcate our leadership with our values, teaching from case studies How are you doing in your diversity e Ưorts? We are proud of our diversity … but we have more to do. Our women leaders represent more than 30% of our company’s senior leadership, and they run major businesses – several units on their own would be among Fortune 1000 companies. In addition to having three women on our Operating Committee – who run Asset Management, Finance and Legal – some of our other businesses and functions headed by women include Auto Finance, Business Banking, U.S. Private Bank, U.S. Mergers & Acquisitions, Global Equity Capital Markets, Global Research, Regulatory AƯairs, Global Philanthropy, our U.S. branch network and ﬁrmwide Marketing. I believe that we have some of the best women leaders in the corporate world globally. To encourage diversity and inclusion in the workplace, we have a number of Business Resource Groups (BRG) across the company to bring together members around common interests, as well as foster networking and camaraderie. Groups are deﬁned by shared aƯinities, including race and cultural heritage, generation, gender, sexual orientation, military status and professional role. For example, some of our largest BRGs are Adelante for Hispanic and Latino employees, Access Ability for employees a Ưected by a disability, AsPIRE for Asian and Paciﬁc Islander employees, NextGen for early career professionals and WIN, which focuses on women and their career development. WIN has more than 20,000 members globally, and we have seen a direct correlation between BRG membership and increased promotion, mobility and retention for those participants. On the facing page, you can read more about some of the interesting new programs we have rolled out for employees in speciﬁc situations. But there is one area where we simply have not met the standards that JPMorgan Chase sets for itself – and that is in increasing African- American talent at the ﬁrm. While we think our e Ưort to attract and retain African-American talent is as good as at most other companies, it simply is not good enough. Therefore, we set up a devoted e Ưort – as we did for hiring veterans (we’ve hired 10,000+ veterans) – to dramatically step up our e Ưort. We have launched Advancing Black Leaders – a separately sta Ưed and managed initiative to better attract and hire more African-American talent while retaining, developing and advancing the African-American talent we already have. We are taking deﬁnitive steps to ensure a successful outcome, including an incremental $5 million investment, identifying a full-time senior executive to drive the initiative, tripling the number of scholarships we o Ưer to students in this community, and launching bias -awareness training for all executive directors and managing directors. We hope that, over the years, this concerted action will make a huge di Ưerence. 25 WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO MAKE JPMORGAN CHASE AN EVEN BETTER PLACE TO WORK We want JPMorgan Chase to be considered the best place to work — period. Below are some meaningful new programs that will help us both attract talent and keep our best people. Our ReEntry program. Our ReEntry program, now in its third year, has been incredibly successful in helping individuals who have taken a ﬁve- to 10- year or longer voluntary break get back into the workforce. These are highly accomplished professionals who have prior ﬁnancial services experience at or above the vice president level but who may need help re-entering the corporate work environment. We o Ưer participants an 18 -week fellowship to refresh their skills and rebuild their network. It is a great way to bring outstanding, experienced workers — who often are women — to JPMorgan Chase to begin the second phase of their career. In three years, 63 fellows have been brought into the program, and 50 of those fellows have been placed in full-time roles. Maternity mentors. A common reason for taking a prolonged break from work is the birth of a child. Becoming a parent is both joyful and stressful so we want to do everything we can to support our employees through this lifechanging event. Last year, we extended primary caregiver parental leave to 16 weeks, up from 12, and, this year, we are introducing a ﬁrmwide maternity mentorship program. The program will pair senior employees who have gone through the parental leave process with those who are doing so for the ﬁrst time. It was piloted last year to overwhelmingly positive feedback, with participants expressing deep appreciation for having a colleague they could turn to for advice on everything from how to balance work with their new home dynamic to nursing room protocol. Importantly, these senior mentors also provide peace of mind around job security and how to manage the entire transition, from preparing to leave, managing motherhood during the leave and returning to work. In addition, this program not only supports the employee going out on maternity leave, but it also helps educate the employee’s manager — on how to stay connected with the employee and ensure that the leave is being handled with ﬂexibility and sensitivity in order to give the employee comfort that her role will be there upon her return. Work-life balance. We speak consistently about the need for our employees to take care of their minds, their bodies and their souls. This is the responsibility of each and every employee, but there are also ways the ﬁrm can help. People frequently think work-life balance refers to working parents; however, having an e Ưective balance is important for everyone’s well-being, including our junior investment bankers. In the Investment Bank, we have reduced weekend work to only essential execution work for all employees. And the protected weekend program for analysts and associates will remain in place and now is mandatory for all at this level globally. 26 With all the new rules, committees and centralization, how can you ﬁght bureaucracy and complacency and keep morale high? In the reality of our new world, centralization of many critical functions is an absolute requirement so that we can maintain common standards across the company. Of course, extreme centralization can lead to stiﬂing bureaucracy, less innovation and, counterintuitively, sometimes a lack of accountability on the part of those who should have it. Our preference is to decentralize when we can, but when we have to centralize, we need to ensure we set up a process that’s e Ưicient, works for the customer and respects the internal colleagues who may have lost some local control. Processes need to be re- engineered to be e Ưicient. So far, our managers have done a great job adjusting to their new roles and, in e Ưect, getting the best of centralization without its shortcomings. When, on occasion, new procedures have slowed down our response rate to the client, we quickly set about re-engineering the process to make it better. While we are going to meet and exceed all rules and requirements, we need to ensure that the process is not duplicative or that rules are not misapplied. For example, adhering to the new KYC rules took us up to 10 days to onboard a client to our Private Bank. But today, after re-engineering the process, we are back down to three days, incorporating enhanced controls. We all need to recognize that good processes generally are faster, cheaper and safer for all involved, including the client. People should not just accept bureaucracy — they have the right to question processes and the interpretation of rules. We have given all our people the license to question whether what we are doing is the right thing, including the interpretation of rules and regulations. Very often, in our desire to exceed regulatory requirements and to avoid making a mistake, we have inaccurately interpreted a rule or regulation and created our own excessive bureaucracy. This is no one’s fault but our own. Everyone should look to simplify and seek out best practices, including asking our regulators for guidance. Committees need to be properly run — the chairperson needs to take charge. We have asked all our committees to become more e Ưicient. For example, we should ensure that pre-reading materials are accurate and succinct. The right people need to be in the room and very rarely should the group exceed 12 people. An issue should not be presented to multiple committees when it could be dealt with in just one committee (remember, we have new business initiative approval committees, credit committees, reputational risk committees, capital governance committees, global technology architecture committees and hundreds of others). We have asked that each chair of every committee take charge – start meetings on time, make sure people arrive prepared and actually have read the pre-read documents, eliminate frivolous conversation, force the right questions to get to a decision, read the riot act to someone behaving badly, maintain a detailed follow-up list specifying who is responsible for what and when, and ensure the committee meets its obligations and time commitments. And last, we encourage each chair to ask the internal customers if he or she is doing a good job for them. We have maintained high morale. Our people have embraced the new regulations and are working hard to become the gold standard in how we operate. We don’t spend any time ﬁnger-pointing or scapegoating our own people, looking for someone to blame purely for the sake of doing so when we make a mistake. And importantly, we have maintained a culture that allows for mistakes. Obviously, if someone violates our core principles, that person should not be here. But as you know, there are all types of mistakes. 27 We don’t want to be known as a company that doesn’t give people a second chance regardless of the circumstances. I remind all our managers that some of these mistakes will be made by our children, our spouses or our parents. Having a brutal, uncompromising and unforgiving company will create a terrible culture over time – and it will lead to worse conduct not better. Quite well, thank you. The Board of Directors and I feel we have one of the best management teams we have ever had. Many of our investors who have spent a considerable amount of time with our leaders – not just with my direct reports but with the layer of management below them – will tell you how impressed they are with the depth and breadth of our management team. Of course, we have lost some people, but we wish them well – we are proud of our alumni. One of the negatives of being a good company is that you do become a breeding ground for talent and a recruiting target for competitors. It is the job of our management team to keep our key talent educated, engaged, motivated and happy. Our people are so good that we should say thank you every day. How are you doing retaining key people? Our company has stood the test of time because we are building a strong culture and are embedding our principles in everything we do. Nothing is more important. That is the pillar upon which all things rest – and it is the foundation for a successful future. 28 IV. WE ARE HERE TO SERVE OUR CLIENTS We have to be innovating all the time to succeed. Investing in the future is critical to our business and crucial for our growth. Every year we ask, “Are we doing enough? And should we be spending more?” We do not cut back on “good spending” to meet budget or earnings targets. We view this type of cost cutting like an airline scaling back on maintenance – it’s a bad idea. We spent more than $9 billion last year on technology. Importantly, 30% of this total amount was spent on new investments for the future. Today, we have more than 40,000 technologists, from programmers and analysts to systems engineers and application designers. In addition, our resources include 31 data centers, 67,000 physical servers globally, 27,920 databases and a global network that operates smoothly for all our clients. There are many new technologies that I will not discuss here (think cloud, containerization and virtualization) but which will make every single part of this ecosystem increasingly more e Ưicient over time. We need to innovate in both big and small ways. Technology often comes in big waves – such as computerization, the Internet and mobile devices. However, plenty of important innovation involves lots of little things that are additive over time and make a product or a service better or faster; for example, simplifying online applications, improving ATMs to do more (e.g., depositing checks) and speeding up credit underwriting. Many of these improvements were not just the result of technology but the result of teams of people across Legal, Finance, Technology and Client Coverage & Support working together to understand, simplify and automate processes. One of our growing teams is our digital group, including more than 400 professionals focused on product and platform design and innovation. In addition, the digital technology organization has over 1,200 technologists that deliver digital solutions, including frameworks, development and architecture. This is an exceptional group, but you can judge for yourself when you read about some of the great projects being rolled out. We have thousands of such projects, but I just want to give you a sample of some of our current initiatives (I will talk extensively later about investments in payments, in big data and in our Investment Bank): • Consumer digital. We are intently focused on delivering di Ưerentiated digital experiences across our consumer businesses. For example, we added new functionality to our mobile app with account preview and check viewing, and we redesigned chase.com with simpler navigation and more personalized experiences, making it easier for our customers to bank and interact with us when and how they want – via smartphones, laptops and other mobile devices. We now have nearly 23 million active Chase Mobile customers, a 20% increase over the prior year. Many of the new and exciting things we are doing center on technology, including big data and FinTech. We are continually innovating to serve our clients better, faster and cheaper – year after year. How do you view innovation, technology and FinTech? And have banks been good innovators? Do you have economies of scale, and how are they beneﬁting your clients? 28 29 • Digital and Global Wealth Management. We will be investing approximately $300 million over the next three years in digital initiatives for Asset Management. In Global Wealth Management, we have modernized the online experience for clients, enabled mobile access, and launched a digital portal for access to our research and analysis across all channels. In addition, we are rolling out a userfriendly and powerful planning tool that our advisors can use with clients in real time. We are also working on some great new initiatives around digital wealth management, which we will disclose later this year. • Digital Commercial Banking. In Commercial Banking, J.P. Morgan ACCESS delivers a platform for clients to manage and pull together all their Treasury activities in a single, secure portal, which was ranked as the #1 cash management portal in North America by Greenwich Associates in 2014. We continue to invest in digital enhancements, releasing in 2015 our proprietary and integrated mobile solution for remote check deposits to help clients further streamline their back- oƯice reconciliations. We are also investing in improving the overall user experience around key items such as entitlements (designating who can make payments) and workﬂow, bringing to our commercial digital platforms some of the same enhancements we’ve brought to our Consumer Banking sites. While we make a huge e Ưort to protect our own company in terms of cybersecurity, we try to help protect our clients from cyber threats as well. We have extensive fraud and malware detection capabilities that signiﬁcantly reduce wire fraud on our customers. We’ve increased our client cybersecurity education and awareness programs, having communicated with more than 11,000 corporate customers on this topic and hosting nearly 50 cybersecurity client events in 2015. • Small business digital. Small businesses are important to Chase and to the communities we serve. Small businesses have a variety of banking needs, with approximately 60% of our customers using our checking accounts or business credit cards. And like our consumer client base, they depend heavily on the technology that already is o Ưered in our Consumer business. But we are very excited about two new initiatives this year: – Our new brand “Chase for Business” is not just a brand. Over time, we will simplify forms, speed applications and dramatically improve the customer experience. This year or next, we will roll out an online digital application that allows a Business Banking customer to sign up for the “triple play” with one signature and in one day. “Triple play” stands for a deposit account, a business credit card and Chase merchant processing – all at once. Now that’s customer service! – Chase Business Quick Capital. Working with a FinTech company called OnDeck, we will be piloting a new working capital product. The process will be entirely digital, with approval and funding generally received within one day vs. the current process that can take up to one month or more. The loans will be Chase branded, retained on our balance sheet, and subject to our pricing and risk parameters. • Commercial Term Lending. In our Commercial Term Lending business, our competitive advantage is our process – we strive to close commercial real estate loans faster and more e Ưiciently than the industry average. That has allowed us to drive $25 billion of loan growth since 2010, representing a ﬁve-year compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 11% and outpacing the industry CAGR of 4% while maintaining credit discipline. Technological innovation will continue to improve our process – later in the year, we will be rolling out a proprietary loan 29 30 origination system that will set a new industry standard for closure speed and customer service. Yes, we are always improving our economies of scale (to the ultimate beneﬁt of our clients). And yes, over time, banks have been enormous innovators. We commonly hear the comment that a bank of our size cannot generate economies of scale that beneﬁt the client. And we often hear people say that banks don’t innovate. Neither of these comments is accurate. Below I give a few examples of the large and small innovations that we are working on: • Consumer and small business banking accounts. Many decades ago, bank accounts meant checks and a monthly statement, with few additional beneﬁts provided to customers (other than maybe a toaster). Today, most checking accounts come with many beneﬁts: debit cards, online bill pay, 24-hour access to online account information, fraud alerts, mobile banking, relevant rewards and ATM access. • ATMs. Today, ATMs are ubiquitous (we have almost 18,000 ATMs, and our customers love them). These ATMs have gone from simple cash dispensers to state-of-the-art service centers, allowing customers to receive di Ưerent denominations of bills, accept deposited checks, pay certain bills and access all their accounts. • The cost and ability to raise capital and buy and sell securities. Thirty years ago, it cost, on average, 15 cents to trade a share of stock, 100 basis points to buy or sell a corporate single-A bond and $200,000 to do a $100 million interest rate swap. Today, it costs, on average, 1.5 cents to trade a share of stock, 10 basis points to buy a corporate single-A bond and $10,000 to do a $100 million interest rate swap. And much can be done electronically, increasingly on a mobile device and with mostly straight-through processing, which reduces error rates and operational costs – for both us and our clients. These capabilities have dramatically reduced costs to investors and issuers for capital raising and securities transactions. • Cash management capabilities for corporations. It is impossible to describe in a few sentences what companies had to do to move money around the world 40 years ago. Today, people can move money globally on mobile devices and immediately convert it into almost any currency they want. They have instant access to information, and the cost is a fraction of what it used to be. FinTech and innovation have been going on my entire career — it’s just faster today. If you look at the banking business over decades, it has always been a huge user of new technologies. This has been going on my entire career, though it does appear to be accelerating and coming at us from many di Ưerent angles. While many FinTech ﬁrms are good at utilizing new technologies, we should recognize that they are very good at analyzing and ﬁxing business problems and improving the customer experience (i.e., reducing pain points). Sometimes they ﬁnd a way to provide these services more e Ưiciently and in a less costly manner; for example, cloud services. And sometimes these services are not less expensive but provide a faster and simpliﬁed experience that customers value and are willing to pay for. You see this in some FinTech lending and payment services. It is unquestionable that FinTech will force ﬁnancial institutions to move more quickly, and banks, regulators and government policy will need to keep pace. Services will be rolled out faster, and more of them will be executed on a mobile device. FinTech has been great at making it easier and often less expensive for customers and will likely lead to many more people, including more lower-income people, joining the banking system in the United States and abroad. 30 31 You can rest assured that we continually and vigorously analyze the marketplace, including FinTech companies. We want to stay up to date and be extremely informed, and we are always looking for ways to improve what we do. We are perfectly willing to compete by building capabilities (we have large capabilities in-house) or to collaborate by partnering. Whether we compete or collaborate, we try to do what is in the best interest of the customer. We also partner with more than 100 FinTech companies – just as we have partnered over the past decade with hundreds of other technology providers. We need to be very technologically competent because we know that some of our competitors will be very good. All businesses have clear weak spots, and those weaknesses will be – and should be – exploited by competitors. This is how competitive markets work. One of the areas we spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about is payments. Part of the payments system is based on archaic, legacy architecture that is often unfriendly to the customer. How do you intend to win in payments, particularly with so many strong competitors — many from Silicon Valley? Right now, we are one of the biggest payments companies in the world (across credit and debit cards, merchant payments, global wire transfers, etc.). But that has not lulled us into a false sense of security – and we know we need to continue to innovate aggressively to grow and win in this area. The trifecta of Chase Paymentech, ChaseNet and Chase Pay, supported by signiﬁcant investment in innovation, has us very excited and gives us a great opportunity to continue to be one of the leading companies in the payments business. Let me explain why. Chase Paymentech. We already are one of the largest merchant processors in the United States (merchant processors provide those little machines that you swipe your card through at the point of sale in a store or that process online payments). We are quickly signing up large and medium-sized merchants – this year alone, we signed up some names that you all recognize, including Starbucks, Chevron, Marriott, Rite Aid and Cinemark. And I’ve already described how the partnership with Business Banking makes it easier for small businesses to connect with Chase Paymentech. In all these instances, we have simpliﬁed, and, in some cases, o Ưered better pricing, as well as made signup easier – exactly what the merchants want. And very often it comes with … ChaseNet. ChaseNet. ChaseNet, through Visa, allows us to o Ưer a merchant di Ưerent and cheaper pricing, a streamlined contract and rules, and enhanced data sharing, which can facilitate sales and authorization rates. Again, these are all things merchants want. (You can see that we are trying hard to improve the relationship between banks and merchants.) We expect volume in ChaseNet to reach approximately $50 billion in 2016 (up 100% from 2015), as we have signed up and are starting to onboard clients such as Starbucks, Chevron, Marriott and Rite Aid. In conjunction with Chase Paymentech and ChaseNet, both of which allow us to o Ưer merchants great deals, we also can o Ưer … Chase Pay. Chase Pay. Chase Pay, our Chase -branded digital wallet, is the digital equivalent to using your debit or credit card. It will allow you to pay online with a “Chase Pay” button or in-store with your mobile phone. We also hope to get the Chase Pay button inside merchant apps. Chase Pay will o Ưer lower cost of payment, loyalty programs and fraud liability protection to merchants, as well as simple checkout, loyalty rewards and account protection to consumers. As one great example, Chase has signed a payments agreement with Starbucks, which, we hope, will drive Chase Pay adoption. Customers will be able to use the Chase Pay mobile app at more 31 32 than 7,500 company-operated Starbucks locations in the United States and to reload a Starbucks Card within the Starbucks mobile app and on starbucks.com. Finally, to make Chase Pay even more attractive, we are building … real-time person- toperson (P2P) payments. Real-time P2P payments. In conjunction with six partner banks, Chase is launching a P2P solution with real-time funds availability. The new P2P solution will securely make real-time funds available through a single consumerfacing brand. Chase and the partner banks represent 60% of all U.S. consumers with mobile banking apps. We intend to keep P2P free for consumers, and the network consortium is open for all banks to join. We are absolutely convinced that the trifecta – Chase Paymentech, ChaseNet and Chase Pay – will be dramatically better, cheaper and safer for our customers and our merchants. We also are convinced that the investments we are making in Chase Paymentech and ChaseNet will pay o Ư handsomely. The investment in Chase Pay is not as certain. But we think that the investment will be worth it and that it will help drive more merchants wanting to do business with us and more customers wanting to open checking accounts with us and use our credit cards. I also want to mention one more payment capability, this one for our corporate clients: Corporate QuickPay. Leveraging tremendous investment in our retail payment capabilities, our wholesale businesses launched Corporate QuickPay in 2015. This mobile and web-based solution provides our clients with a low-cost alternative to expensive paper checks, reducing their expenses by almost two-thirds. In addition, the platform dramatically improves security, increases paymentprocessing speed, eases reporting and signiﬁcantly enhances the customer experience. I hope you can see why we are so excited. You always seem to be segmenting your businesses — how and why are you doing this? We will always be segmenting our businesses to become more knowledgeable about and closer to the client. This segmentation allows us to tailor our products and services to better serve their needs. Below are some examples of how and why we do this. In Consumer Banking, we have the beneﬁt of really knowing our customers. We know about their ﬁnancial stability, interests, where they live and their families. That data can be a tremendous force in serving them. By understanding customers well beyond a demographic proﬁle, we can better anticipate what they need. Historically, we used demographics and behavior to segment our customers, but we increasingly take attitudes, values and aspirations into consideration to o Ưer each customer more relevant and personalized products, services and rewards. As one important example, we hope to roll out an “Always On O Ưers” section for our customers on chase.com, where they can access all the products they qualify for at any given time. In Commercial Banking, we continue to develop and enhance our Specialized Industries coverage, which now serves a total of 15 distinct industries and approximately 9,000 clients across the United States, with eight industries launched in the last ﬁve years. Below are a few service examples taken from these new industries: • Agricultural industry group. Not only do we have specialized underwriting for clients within this group, but we also can help our clients navigate commodity price cycles and seasonality, as well as provide industry-speciﬁc credit and risk management tools, such as interest rate and commodity hedging. 32 33 • Healthcare industry group. In addition to delivering access to capital and other ﬁnancial services, we can help our healthcare clients manage the constantly changing regulatory environment and adjust their businesses to comply with the Patient Protection and A Ưordable Care Act and other new regulations. In addition, our web-based tools are making it easier for healthcare providers to migrate payments from expensive paper checks to e Ưicient electronic transactions. • Technology industry group. To serve our technology clients, we have expanded our coverage to include 30 bankers in 11 key markets, all highly aligned with our Investment Banking team. With this model, we can provide investment banking services, comprehensive payment capabilities and international products to address the needs of technology clients through every stage of growth. In Asset Management, we have dedicated groups that cover highly specialized segments. Some of these segments are: Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension Plans, Deﬁned Contribution Pension Plans, Endowments & Foundations, Family O Ưices and Insurance Companies. How and why do you use big data? We have enormous quantities of data, and we have always been data fanatics, using big data responsibly in loan underwriting, market-making, client selection, credit underwriting and risk management, among other areas. But comparing today’s big data with yesterday’s old- style data is like the di Ưerence between a mobile phone and a rotary phone. Big data truly is powerful and can be used extensively to improve our company. To best utilize our data assets and spur innovation, we have built our own extraordinary in-house big data capabilities – we think as good as any in Silicon Valley – populated with more than 200 analysts and data scientists, which we call Intelligent Solutions. And we are starting to use these capabilities across all our businesses. I want to give you a sample of what we are doing – and it is just the beginning: • Commercial Banking. We are using big data in many ways in Commercial Banking. One area is responsible prospecting. It always was hard to get a proper list of client prospects (i.e., get the prospect’s working telephone number or email address, get an accurate description of the business and maybe get an introduction to the decision maker at the company). Using big data, we have uncovered and qualiﬁed twice as many high- quality prospects, and we are signiﬁcantly more e Ưective in assuring that the best banker is calling on the highest-potential prospects. This has given us conﬁdence in knowing that if we hire more bankers, they can be proﬁtably deployed. • Consumer Banking. Within the Consumer Bank, we use big data to improve underwriting, deliver more targeted marketing and analyze the root causes of customer attrition. This will lead to more accounts, higher marketing e Ưiciencies, reduced costs and happy customers. 33 34 • Operational e Ưiciencies. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, big data is being used to analyze errors, thereby improving operational eƯiciencies. In one example, in our Custody business, big data is helping identify and explain the breaks and variances in the calculation of net asset values of funds, thereby reducing the operational burden and improving client service. • Operational intelligence. Our technology infrastructure creates an enormous amount of machine data from which we gain valuable operational intelligence. This information helps support the stability and resiliency of our systems – enabling us to identify little problems before they become big problems. • Fraud security and surveillance. Needless to say, these big data capabilities are being used to decrease fraud, reduce risk in the cyber world, and even monitor internal systems to detect employee fraud and bad behavior. Why are you investing in sales and trading, as well as in your Investment Bank, when others seem to be cutting back? Trading is an absolutely critical function in modern society – for investors large and small and for corporations and governments. As the world grows, the absolute need for trading will increase globally as assets under management, trade, corporate clients and economies grow. We disclosed on Investor Day that we continue to make a fair proﬁt in almost all our trading businesses despite the higher costs and what is probably a permanent reduction in volumes. While the business will always be cyclical, we are convinced that our clients will continue to need broad services in all asset classes and that we have the scale to be proﬁtable through the cycle. Sales and trading educates the world about companies, securities and economies. Clients will always need advice and the ability to transact. This education also makes it easier for corporations to sell their securities so they can invest and grow. Much of the investment we are making in sales and trading is in technology, both to adjust to new regulations and to make access to trading faster, cheaper and safer than it has been in the past. Across electronic trading, we have seen a doubling of users and signiﬁcant volume increases of 175% across products in just the last year. Below are a few examples: Foreign exchange (FX). We continue to make signiﬁcant investments in FX e-trading and our single-dealer platform. More than 95% of our FX spot transactions are now done electronically as the market has increasingly shifted to electronic execution over the years. We were also ﬁrst to deliver FX trading on mobile devices through our award-winning eXecute application on the J.P. Morgan Markets platform. Our continued investment in the FX business, in which we process an average of nearly 500,000 trades each day, has propelled us to be a leader in the market. Equities. In the last ﬁve years, on the back of our investments in both technology and people, our U.S. electronic cash equity market share has nearly quadrupled. We have also witnessed an increased straightthrough processing rate – going from 70% two years ago to 97% today. Prime Brokerage. Our Prime Brokerage platform, which was once a predominantly U.S. operation, is now a top-tier global business that continues to grow clients and balances. Our international and DMA (direct market access) electronic footprint has expanded rapidly since 2012. Financing balances are at all-time highs, with international balances up more than 60% and synthetic balances up more than 350%, simultaneously reducing balance sheet consumption and enhancing returns. 34 35 Rates trading. With the adoption of new regulations, we anticipate that this market will also continue to see increased volumes of e-trading. As a result, we have developed automated pricing systems that can price swaps in a fraction of a second on electronic platforms. Our SEF (swap execution facility) aggregator allows clients to see the best price available to them across the global market of interest rate swaps and “click to trade” via our platform on an agency basis. This helps our clients execute transactions via any channel they desire, on a principal or agent basis. Today, over 50% of our U.S. dollar swaps volume is traded and processed electronically. Commodities. Leveraging our FX capabilities, we have developed a complete electronic o Ưering in precious and base metals. We are also extending the same capabilities to energy products, where we have executed our ﬁrst electronic trade in oil. We plan to further extend our e-trading capabilities across the commodities markets, including agricultural products. Derivatives processing. The implementation of our strategic over-the-counter derivatives processing platform has promoted a 30% increase in portfolio volume and a more than 50% decrease in cost per trade in four years. The platform now settles $2.2 trillion of derivative notionals each day and has been instrumental in improving operational Why are you still in the mortgage business? That is a valid question. The mortgage business can be volatile and has experienced increasingly lower returns as new regulations add both sizable costs and higher capital requirements. In addition, it is not just the cost of the new rules in origination and servicing, it is the enormous complexity of those new requirements that can lead to problems and errors. It is now virtually impossible not to make some mistakes – and as you know, the price for making an error is very high. So why do we want to stay in this business? Here’s why: delivery, control and client service, as demonstrated by a more than 60% reduction in cash settlement breaks and a 50% increase in straight-through processing of equity derivatives conﬁrmations. In all these cases, greater operational e Ưiciencies and higher straight-through processing drive lower costs and lead to happy clients. We also continue to make investments in research and the coverage of clients. A couple of examples will su Ưice: Research platform. We continue our research investments both in the quality of our people and in the number of companies and sectors we cover. In 2015, we expanded our global equity research coverage to more than 3,700 companies, the broadest equity company coverage platform among our competitors. With material increases in the United States – we expanded sector coverage in energy, banks, insurance and industrials – and in China, we doubled our A-share coverage. Increased Investment Banking coverage. We are actively recruiting and hiring senior bankers in areas where we were either underpenetrated or where there has been incremental secular growth, such as energy, technology, healthcare and Greater China. • Mortgages are important to our customers. For most of our customers, their home is the single largest purchase they will make in their lifetime. More than that, it is an emotional purchase – it is where they are getting their start, raising a family or maybe spending their retirement years. As a bank that wants to build lifelong relationships with its customers, we want to be there for them at life’s most critical junctures. Mortgages are important to our customers, and we still believe that we have the brand and scale to build a higherquality and less volatile mortgage business. 35 36 • Originations. We reduced our product set from 37 to 15, we will complete the rollout of a new originations system, and we will continue to leverage digital channels to make the application process easier for our customers and more e Ưicient for us. In addition, we have dramatically reduced Federal Housing Administration (FHA) originations. Currently, it simply is too costly and too risky to originate these kinds of mortgages. Part of the risk comes from the penalties that the government charges if you make a mistake – and part of the risk is because these types of mortgages default frequently. And in the new world, the cost of default servicing is extraordinarily high. • Servicing. If we had our druthers, we would never service a defaulted mortgage again. We do not want to be in the business of foreclosure because it is exceedingly painful for our customers, and it is diƯicult, costly and painful to us and our reputation. In part, by making fewer FHA loans, we have helped reduce our foreclosure inventory by more than 80%, and we are negotiating arrangements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to have any delinquent mortgages insured by them be serviced by them. • Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending. Finally, while making fewer FHA loans can make it more di Ưicult to meet our Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending obligations, we believe we have solutions in place to responsibly meet these obligations – both the more subjective requirements and the quantitative components – without unduly jeopardizing our company. 36 37 V. WE HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED OUR COMMUNITIES Most large companies are outstanding corporate citizens – and they have been for a long time. They compensate their people fairly, they provide critical medical and retirement plans, and they’re in the forefront of social policy; for example, in sta Ưing a diverse You seem to be doing more and more to support your communities — how and why? Since our founding in New York more than 200 years ago, JPMorgan Chase and its predecessor banks have been leaders in their communities. This is nothing new. For example, in April 1906, J.P. Morgan & Co. made Wall Street’s largest contribution – $25,000 – to, as The New York Times described it at the time, “extend practical sympathy to the stricken people of San Francisco.” This was two days after the earthquake that destroyed 80% of the city and killed 3,000 people. In February 2016, we played much the same role when the ﬁrm and our employees contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for medical services for children exposed to lead in the Flint, Michigan, water crisis. And over the last several years, we have given more than $20 million to help in the aftermath of natural disasters, from tsunamis in Asia to Superstorm Sandy in the northeast United States (and it was gratifying to see how employees rallied with their time and with the full resources of the ﬁrm to help). workforce, hiring veterans and e Ưectively training people for jobs. They, like all institutions, are not perfect, but they try their best to obey the spirit and the letter of the laws of the land in which they operate. In addition to our annual philanthropic giving – which now totals over $200 million a year – we are putting our resources, the expertise of our business leaders, our data, relationships and knowledge of global markets into signiﬁcant e Ưorts aimed at boosting economic growth and expanding opportunity for those being left behind in today’s economy. We have made long-term global commitments to workforce readiness, getting small businesses the capital and support they need to grow, improving consumer ﬁnancial health and supporting strong urban economies. You can read more detail about these programs on pages 71-72. And in the sidebars in this section, you can hear directly from some of our partners about our e Ưorts. We think these initiatives will make a signiﬁcant contribution to creating more economic opportunity for more people around the world. In particular, I want to tell you about an exciting new community service program we have developed that is capitalizing on our most important resource – the talent of our people. The Service Corps program recruits top-performing employees from around the world to put their skills and expertise to work on behalf of nonproﬁt partners that are helping to build stronger communities. This program, combining leadership development with philanthropic purpose, started small in Brazil, grew into the Detroit Service Corps as part of our investment there, and has now spread across the globe, with projects in Africa, Asia, and North and South 37 38 America. Service Corps employees work on-site with nonproﬁts on projects that last three weeks. In total, 64 people have been involved in 22 projects. And this program will continue to grow in the coming years to other domestic and international locations. While supporting our nonproﬁt partners to deliver on their mission, our employees also gain enormous satisfaction and sense of purpose from the opportunity to help. In addition, as they travel across the globe and interact with their peers, they develop a great, permanent camaraderie that helps unite our employees from around the world in a commitment to make a di Ưerence in our communities. PARTNERSHIP IN DETROIT by Mayor Mike Duggan Detroit is coming back. After years of challenges, we are seeing signs of real progress in our neighborhoods and business districts. Two years into our administration, we’ve brought back ﬁscal discipline and have balanced the city’s budget for the ﬁrst time in more than a decade. We’ve installed 61,000 new LED streetlights in our neighborhoods. Buses are running on schedule for the ﬁrst time in 20 years and are serving 100,000 more riders each week. We’ve taken down nearly 8,000 blighted homes and, as a result, are seeing double-digit property value increases across the majority of the city. Perhaps most important, 8,000 more Detroiters are working today than two years ago, thanks to e Ưorts to attract new investment and develop our workforce. None of these positive steps would have been possible without the partnerships we’ve established in Washington, D.C., in our state capital of Lansing, with the Detroit City Council, and especially with our residents and partners in the business and philanthropic communities. When our friends at JPMorgan Chase started thinking about making a $100 million investment in Detroit, they started oƯ by asking about our priorities for the city’s recovery — not just mine but those of our community and philanthropic leaders as well. Today, we can see the impact of JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to Detroit in many places — in the opening of a new grocery store in the Westside’s Harmony Village neighborhood, in the minority-led small businesses that are getting much-needed capital from the new Entrepreneurs of Color Fund and in the map of Detroit’s workforce system that is helping us prepare Detroiters for the new jobs coming to the city. JPMorgan Chase is bringing its data, expertise and talent to this town in so many ways — assets that are just as important as money in boosting our recovery. The partnerships JPMorgan Chase saw at work in Detroit helped give the ﬁrm conﬁdence to invest so signiﬁcantly in our city. And because we have this ﬁne company at the table, we now have other companies coming to our city looking to contribute and invest in Detroit and its residents. We still have a long way to go. But with great partners like JPMorgan Chase, we are creating a turnaround that is beneﬁting all Detroiters and can be a model for other large cities facing similar challenges. 38 39 CREATING CAREER-FOCUSED EDUCATION by Freeman A. Hrabowski III, President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County Too many people are left out of work or are stuck in low-wage, low-skill jobs without a path to meaningful employment and the chance to get ahead. Among young people, this truly is a national tragedy: More than 5 million young Americans, including one in ﬁve African-American and one in six Latino youths, are neither attending school nor working. JPMorgan Chase’s New Skills for Youth initiative is an important example of educators and business leaders partnering to equip young people with the skills and experience to be career ready. The social and economic hurdles faced by young people of color and those who come from lowincome families have been exacerbated by the growing crisis of high inner city unemployment and low high school graduation rates. With too many young people marginalized, economic growth slows, and social challenges increase. The public and private sectors must work together to change this. Educators need to emphasize both college and career readiness. They need to recognize that there is growing demand for technically trained, middle-skill workers — from robotics technicians to licensed practical nurses — and better align what they teach with the talent needs of employers. At the same time, business leaders need to support the education system as it strives to teach today’s skills and help students develop into critical thinkers. A bachelor’s degree is as important as ever, and universities must do more to support students of all backgrounds who arrive on our campuses. However, we need to recognize that not all college and career pathways include pursuing a four-year degree immediately, and we need to eliminate the stigma attached to alternate paths. High-quality, rigorous career and technical education programs can connect people to high-skill, well-paying jobs — and they don’t preclude earning a four-year degree down the road. Classes dedicated to robotics, medical science, mechanics and coding build skills that employers desperately need. They also prepare students to land great jobs. Recent education reforms are making progress, but we still need greater focus on preparing young people, from all income levels, with the skills and experiences to be college and career ready. The public and private sectors need to forge deeper relationships and make greater investments in developing and expanding e Ưective models of career -focused education that are aligned with the needs of emerging industries. This is an investment not only in growing our economy but also in providing more of our young people with a tangible path out of poverty and a real chance at economic success. COMMITMENT TO OUR VETS by Stan McChrystal, Retired General, U.S. Army In early 2011, two employees of JPMorgan Chase came to wintry New Haven, Connecticut, to talk about veterans. Speciﬁcally, they told me that Jamie Dimon felt the bank could, and should, do more to help the many veterans returning from service — many who were in Iraq and Afghanistan — take their rightful place in civilian society. Since 9/11, the military had enjoyed tremendous support from the American people, but seemingly intractable problems of reintegration, particularly challenges with meaningful employment, haunted an embarrassingly large number of former warriors and their families. I listened with interest and no small amount of cautious skepticism. I was aware of countless programs initiated with the best of intentions that soon became more talk than action and was worried this might be the same. The JPMorgan Chase people asked if I thought the bank should create a program to help veterans ﬁnd employment and if the bank did start such a program, would I join the advisory council for it. I thought for a moment and then responded: “If Jamie is seriously willing to commit the bank to the e Ưort,” I replied, “it’s the right thing to do, and I’m in. If not, there are other, far less ambitious ways to oƯer the bank’s help for veterans.” As we talked further, they convinced me that Jamie, and the full energy that JPMorgan Chase could bring, would be behind the e Ưort. That was almost ﬁve years ago, and JPMorgan Chase has surpassed my every hope and expectation. By committing full-time talent and including the personal involvement of senior leadership, the ﬁrm has been the strongest force in veterans’ employment in America. The Veteran Jobs Mission program has not only implemented truly cuttingedge programs inside the bank to recruit, train, mentor and develop veterans — resulting in an increase of more than 10,000 veterans within the bank since 2011 — but the program also has demonstrated the power of commitment. An impressive number of American businesses have set and met employment goals (to date, over 300,000 veterans have been hired collectively, with a goal of hiring 1 million) that would have been considered unattainable at the start. 40 VI. A SAFE, STRONG BANKING INDUSTRY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO A COUNTRY’S SUCCESS — BANKS’ ROLES HAVE CHANGED, BUT THEY WILL NEVER BE A UTILITY For the people of a country to thrive, you need a successful economy and markets. For an economy to be successful, it is an absolute necessity to have a healthy and successful banking system. The United States has a large, vibrant ﬁnancial system, from asset managers and private equity sponsors to hedge funds, non-banks, venture capitalists, public and private market participants, small to large investors and banks. Banks are at the core of the system. They educate the world about companies and markets, they syndicate credit and market risk, they hold and move money and assets, and they necessarily create discipline among borrowers and transparency in the market. To do this well, America needs all di Ưerent kinds of ﬁnancial institutions and all di Ưerent kinds of banks – large and small. There is a great need for the services of all banks, from large global banks to smaller regional and community banks. That said, our large, global Corporate & Investment Bank does things that regional and community banks simply cannot do. We o Ưer unique capabilities to large corporations, large investors and governments, including federal institutions, states and cities. Only large banks can bank large institutions. Of the 26 million businesses in the United States, only 4,000 are public companies. While accounting for less than 0.02% of all ﬁrms, these companies represent one-third of private sector employment and almost half of the total $2.3 trillion of business capital expenditures. And most are multinationals doing business in many countries around the world. In addition to corporations, governments and government institutions – such as central banks and sovereign wealth funds – need ﬁnancial services. The ﬁnancial needs of all these institutions are extraordinary. We provide many of the services they require. For example, we essentially maintain checking accounts for these institutions in many countries and currencies. We provide extensive credit lines or raise capital for these clients, often in multiple jurisdictions and in multiple currencies. On an average day, JPMorgan Chase Does the United States really need large banks? moves approximately $5 trillion for these types of institutions, raises or lends $6 billion of capital for these institutions, and buys or sells approximately $1.5 trillion of securities to serve investors and issuers. We do all this e Ưiciently and safely for our clients. In addition, as a ﬁrm, we spend approximately $700 million a year on research so that we can educate investors, institutions and governments about economies, markets and companies. For countries, we raised $60 billion of capital in 2015. We help these nations develop their capital markets, get ratings from ratings agencies and, in general, expand their knowledge. The fact is that almost everything we do is because clients want and need our various services. Put “large” in context. While we are a large bank, it might surprise you to know two facts: (1) The assets of all banks in the United States are a much smaller part of the country’s economy, relatively, than in most other large, developed countries; and (2) America’s top ﬁve banks by assets are smaller, relatively, to total banking assets in America than in most other large, developed countries. As shown in the following charts, this framework means banks in the United States are less consolidated. 41 Our size and our diversiﬁcation make us stronger. Our large and diversiﬁed earnings streams and good margins create a strong base of earnings that can withstand many di Ưerent crises. Stock analysts have pointed out that JPMorgan Chase has among the lowest earnings volatility and revenue volatility among all banks. This strength is what allows us to invest in countries to support our clients and to have the staying power to survive tough times. We are a port of safety in almost any storm. Finally, our size gives us the ability to make large and innovative investments that are often needed to create new products and services or to improve our e Ưiciency. The ultimate beneﬁciary of all this is our clients. Community banks are critical to the country — large banks provide essential services to them. (I prepared this section initially as an op-ed article, but I’d like you to see it in total.) Not long ago, I read some commentary excoriating big banks written by the CEO of a regional bank. The grievances weren’t new or surprising – in the current climate, one doesn’t have to look far to ﬁnd someone attacking large ﬁnancial institutions. But I recognized this particular bank as a client of ours. So I did some digging. It turns out that our ﬁrms have a relationship that goes back many years and spans a broad range of services. And it struck me how powerful the incentive is, in today’s heated public dialogue, to frame issues as a winner-take-all ﬁght between opposing interests: big vs. small. Main Street vs. Wall Street. It is a simple narrative, and while banks of all sizes make mistakes, certainly a key lesson of the crisis is that mistakes at the largest institutions can impact the broader ﬁnancial system. But, as is often the case, reality tells a deeper story, and the U.S. ﬁnancial services industry does not conform to simple narratives. It is a complex ecosystem that depends on diverse business models co- existing because there is no other way to e Ưectively serve America’s vast array of customers and clients. A healthy banking system depends on institutions of all sizes to drive innovation, build and support our ﬁnancial infrastructure, and provide the essential services that support the U.S. economy and allow it to thrive. In our system, smaller regional and community banks play an indispensable role. These institutions sit close to the communities they serve. Their highest-ranking corporate oƯicers live in the same neighborhoods as their clients. They are able to forge deep and long-standing relationships and bring a keen knowledge of the local economy and culture. They frequently are able to provide hightouch and specialized banking services, given their unique connection to their communities.

We are proud to have branches and o Ưices all across the country and to have the privilege of being woven into communities large and small. But we respect the fact that for some customers, there is no substitute for a locally based bank and that in some markets, a locally based lender is the best ﬁt for the needs of the community. Having said that, these very same regional and community banks depend on large banks such as ours to make their service oƯerings possible. First, large banks o Ưer vital correspondent banking services for smaller institutions. These services include distributing and collecting physical cash, processing checks and clearing international payments. JPMorgan Chase alone extends such services to 339 small banks and 10 corporate credit unions across the country. Last year, we provided these institutions with $4.7 billion in intraday credit to facilitate cash management activities and processed $7.6 trillion in payments/receivables. Large banks also enable community banks to provide traditional mortgages by purchasing the mortgages that smaller banks originate, selling the loans to the agencies (e.g., Fannie Mae) or capital markets and continuing to service the borrower. In 2015, JPMorgan Chase purchased $10.4 billion in such residential loans from 165 banks nationwide. In addition to these correspondent banking services, large banks deliver mission-critical investment banking services. This includes helping smaller banks access debt and equity capital, supporting them through strategic combinations, enabling them to manage their securities portfolios, providing valuable risk management tools (such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange), creating syndicated credit facilities that smaller banks’ clients can participate in and o Ưering direct ﬁnancing. JPMorgan Chase has raised $16.2 billion in growth equity capital for smaller banks since 2014; advised on strategic combinations among regional and community banks valued at $52 billion; and, last year, provided $5.3 billion in secured repo ﬁnancing, extended $1.4 billion in trading line ﬁnancing and provided $7 billion in other unsecured ﬁnancing to hundreds of banks nationwide. This is a story of symbiosis among our banks rather than a binary choice between big and small. Yes, all banks are competitors in the marketplace. But marketplace competition is not zero-sum. In banking, your competitor can also be your customer. Large banks ultimately would be diminished if regional and community banks were weakened, and, just as surely, those smaller institutions would lose out if America’s large banks were hobbled. We require a system that serves the needs of all Americans, from customers getting their ﬁrst mortgage to farmers and small business owners to our largest multinational companies. America faces enough real challenges without inventing conﬂict where none need exist. Rather, banks of all sizes do themselves and their stakeholders better service by acknowledging the speciﬁc value diƯerent types of institutions o Ưer. Then we all can get on with the business of serving our distinctive roles in strengthening the economy, our communities and our country. Banks cannot be utilities. Utilities are monopolies; i.e., generally only one company is operating in a market. And because of that, prices and returns are regulated. Banks do not have the same relationship with their clients as most other companies do. When a customer walks into a store and wants to buy an item, the store sells it. By contrast, very often a bank needs to turn a customer down; for example, in connection with a credit card or a loan. Responsible lending is good, but irresponsible lending is bad for the economy and for the client (we clearly experienced this in the Great Recession). Banks are more like partners with their clients – and they are often active participants in their clients’ ﬁnancial a Ưairs. They frequently are in the position where they have to insist that clients operate with discipline – by asking for collateral, putting 43 covenants in place or forcing the sale of assets. This does not always create friends, but it is critical for appropriate lending and the proper functioning of markets. Banks have to continuously make judgments on risk, and appropriately price for it, and they have to do this while competing for a client’s business. There is nothing about banking that remotely resembles a utility. America’s ﬁnancial system is the ﬁnest the world has ever seen — let’s ensure it stays that way. The position of America’s leading banks is like many other U.S. industries – they are among the global leaders. If we are not allowed to compete, we will become less diversiﬁed and less e Ưicient. I do not want any American to look back in 20 years and try to ﬁgure out how and why America’s banks lost the leadership position in ﬁnancial services. If not us, it will be someone else and likely a Chinese bank. Today, many Chinese banks already are larger than we are, and they continue to grow rapidly. They are ambitious, they are supported by their government and they have a competitive reason to go global – the Chinese banks are following and supporting their Chinese companies with the ﬁnancial services that are required to expand abroad. Not only are America’s largest banks global leaders, but they help set global standards for ﬁnancial markets, companies, and even countries and controls (such as anti-money laundering). Finally, banks bring huge resources – ﬁnancial and knowledge – to America’s major ﬂagship companies and investors, thereby helping them maintain their global leadership positions. Why do you say that banks need to be steadfast and always there for their clients — doesn’t that always put you in the middle of the storm? Yes, to an extent. When an economy weakens, banks will see it in lower business volumes and higher credit losses. Of course, we want to manage this carefully, but it is part of the cost of doing business. Building a banking business takes decades of training bankers, nurturing relationships, opening branches and developing the proper technology. It is not like buying or selling a stock. Clients, from consumers to countries, expect you to be there in both good times and the toughest of times. Banks and their services are often the essential lifeblood to their clients. Therefore, it is part of the cost of doing business to manage through the cycles. JPMorgan Chase consistently supports consumers, businesses and communities in both good times and the toughest of times. In 2015, the ﬁrm provided $22 billion of credit to U.S. small businesses, which allowed them to develop new products, expand operations and hire more workers; $168 billion of credit to Commercial and Middle Market clients; $233 billion of credit to consumers; more than $68 billion of credit or capital raised for nonproﬁt and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities; and $1.4 trillion of credit or capital raised for corporations. In total, we extended credit and raised capital of more than $2 trillion for our clients. Banks were there for their clients, particularly when the capital markets were not — we need this to continue. The public markets, even though they are populated with a lot of very bright and talented people, are surprisingly ﬁckle. The psychology and wisdom of crowds are not always rational, and they are very impersonal. People who buy and sell securities do not have a moral obligation to provide credit to clients. This is when banks’ longterm relationships and fairly consistent 44  Corporate clients (9)% 20% 7% (11)%  Small business 18% (8)% 5% 11%  Card & Auto (10)% 12% 18% 7%  Commercial/ 11% 8% 41% 1% Middle market  Asset 41% 17% (23)% 29% management  Mortgage/ 22% (7)% (53)% 34% Home equity Total Consumer and 17% 5% (10)% 15% Commercial Banking Year-over-year change ‘11 to ‘12 ‘12 to ‘13 ‘13 to ‘14 ‘14 to ‘15 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 $156 $100 $110 $91 $191 $141 $122 $82 $474 $556 $20 $177 $165 $131 $92 $583 $18 $17 $84 $112 $127 $163 $185 $188 $108 $116 $523 $19 $601 $22 $1.4 $1.3 $1.5 $1.6 $1.4 Corporate clients ($ in trillions) New and Renewed Credit and Capital for our Clients at December 31, Consumer and Commercial Banking ($ in billions) Deposits  Consumer 10% 6% 8% 11%  Wholesale 3% 9% 4% (16)%  Client assets1 10% 13% 3% — % Year-over-year change ‘11 to ‘12 ‘12 to ‘13 ‘13 to ‘14 ‘14 to ‘15 1 Represents assets under management, as well as custody, brokerage, administration and deposit accounts. 2 Represents activities associated with the safekeeping and servicing of assets.

The chart below shows how banks continued to be there for their clients as the markets were not. Corporations get the vital credit they need by issuing securities, including commercial paper, or by borrowing from banks. You can see in the chart below the dramatic drop in the issuance of securities and commercial paper once the ﬁnancial crisis hit. Commercial paper outstanding alone dropped by $1 trillion, starving companies in desperate need of cash. You can see that bank loans outstanding, for the most part, were steady and consistent. This means that banks continued to renew or roll over credit to their clients – small, medium and large – when it was needed the most. This will be a little bit harder to do in the future because capital, liquidity and accounting rules are essentially more procyclical than they were in the past. We estimate that if we were to enter a very di Ưicult market, such as 2008, our capital needs could increase by 10%. Despite the market need for credit, banks would be in a position where, all things being equal, they would need to reduce the credit extended to maintain their own strong capital positions.

This dichotomy also is true with politicians, lawyers and the media – people trust the individuals they know, but when it comes to whether people trust them as a group, they do not. We believe that the only way to be restored to a position of trust is to earn it every day in every community and with every client. The reality is that banks, because of the disciplined role they sometimes have to play and the need to say no in some instances, will not always be the best of friends with some of their clients. But banks still need to discharge that responsibility while continuing to regain a position of trust in society. There is no easy, simple answer other than: • Maintain steadfast, consistent and transparent behavior wherever they operate. • Communicate honestly, clearly and consistently. • Deliver great products and services. • Admitting to mistakes is good, ﬁxing them is better and learning from them is essential. • Make it easy for customers to deal with you – particularly when they have problems. • Work with customers who are struggling – both individuals and companies. • Focus on the customer and treat all clients the way you would want to be treated. • Be great citizens in the community. Establish strong relationships with governments and civic society. • Treat regulators like full partners – and accept that you will not always agree. When they make a change in regulations, even ones you don’t like, accept them and move on. • As an industry, make fewer mistakes and behave better – the bad behavior of one individual reverberates and aƯects the entire industry. Finally, strong regulators and stronger standards for banks must ultimately mean that banks are meeting more rigorous standards. Every bank is doing everything in its power to meet regulatory standards. It has been eight years since the ﬁnancial crisis and six years since Dodd-Frank. Regulators should take more credit for the extraordinary amount that has been accomplished and should state this clearly to the American public. This should help improve consumer conﬁdence in the banking system – and in the economy in general. Consumer and business conﬁdence is the secret sauce for a healthy economy. It is free, and it would be good to sprinkle a bit more of it around. Are you and your regulators thinking more comprehensively and in a forward-looking way to play a role in helping to accelerate global growth? By any reasonable measure, the ﬁnancial system is unquestionably stronger, and regulators deserve a lot of credit for this. But it also is true that thousands of rules, regulations and requirements were made – and needed to be made – quickly. The political and regulatory side wanted it done swiftly to ensure that events that happened in the Great Recession would never happen again. But now is the time when we can and should look at everything more deliberately and assess whether recent reforms have generated unintended consequences that merit attention. Some people speak of regulation like it is a simple, binary tradeo Ư – a stronger system or slower growth or vice versa. We believe that many times you can come up with regulations that do both – create a stronger system and enhance growth. Will banks ever regain a position of trust? How will this be done? 47 There will be a time to comprehensively review, coordinate and modify regulations to ensure maximum safety, create more e Ưiciency and accelerate economic growth. Every major piece of legislation in the United States that was large and complex has been revisited at some point with the intention of making it better. The political time for this is not now, but we should do so for banking regulations someday. We are not looking to rewrite or to start over at all – just some modiﬁcations that make sense. Here are a few speciﬁc examples: • Liquidity. Regulators could give themselves more tools for adjusting liquidity to accommodate market needs. This could be done with modest changes that could actually ameliorate the procyclical nature of the current rules and, in my opinion, enhance safety and soundness and improve the economy. • Mortgages. Finishing and simplifying mortgage rules around origination, servicing, capital requirements and securitizations would help create a more active mortgage market at a lower cost to customers and, again, at no risk to safety and soundness if done right. This, too, would be a plus to consumers and the economy. • Capital rules. Without reducing total capital levels, capital rules could be modiﬁed to be less procyclical, which could serve to both dampen a bubble and soften a bust. This alone could boost the economy and reduce overall economic risk. There are also some rules – for example, requiring that capital be held against a deposit at the Federal Reserve – that distort the normal functioning of the market. These could be eliminated with no risk to safety and soundness unless you think the Fed is a risky investment. Finally, ﬁnishing the capital rules for banks will remove one additional drag on the banks and allow for more consistent capital planning. This would also help to improve conﬁdence in the banks and, by extension, investor conﬁdence. • Increased coordination among regulators. Having ﬁve, six or seven regulators involved in every issue does make things more complicated, expensive and ine Ưicient, not just for banks but for regulators, too. This slows policymaking and rulemaking and is one reason why many of the rules still have not been completed. One of the lessons we have all learned is that policymakers need to move quickly in a crisis. While everyone has worked hard to be more coordinated, far more can be done. • Be more forward looking. This is already happening. As banks are catching up on regulatory demands, the pace of change, while still rapid, is slowing. This sets the stage for both banks and regulators to be able to devote more resources to increasingly critical issues, including cybersecurity, digital services, data protection, FinTech and emerging risks. As the ﬁnancial system reaches the level of strength that regulations require, we hope banks can begin to expand slightly more rapidly (and, of course, responsibly) – both geographically and in terms of products and services – with the support and conﬁdence of their regulators. This will also foster healthy economic growth, which we all so desperately want. 48 VII. GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT Are you worried about bad public policy? Yes, bad public policy, and I’m not looking at this in a partisan way, creates risk for the economies of the world and the living standards of the people on this planet – and, therefore, for the future of JPMorgan Chase – more so than credit or market risks. We have many real-life examples that demonstrate how essential good public policy is to the health and welfare of a country. East Germany vs. West Germany. After World War II, East Germany and West Germany were in equal positions, both having been devastated by the war. After the war, West Germany ﬂourished, creating a vibrant and healthy country for its citizens. East Germany (and, in fact, most of Eastern Europe), operating under diƯerent governance and policies, was a complete disaster. This did not have to be the case. East Germany could have been just as successful as West Germany. This is a perfect example of how important policy is and also of how economics is not a zerosum game. Argentina, Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea vs. Singapore, South Korea, Mexico. These countries also provide us with some pretty strong contrasts. The ﬁrst four countries mentioned above have performed poorly economically. The last three mentioned above have done rather well in the last several decades. You cannot credit this failure or success to the existence of great natural resources because, on both sides, some had these resources, and some did not. It would take too long to articulate it fully here, but strong public policy – ﬁscal, monetary, social, etc. – made all the diƯerence. The countries that did not perform well had many reasons to be successful, but, they were not. In almost all these cases, their government took ine Ưective actions in the name of the people. Detroit. Detroit is an example of failure at the city level. In the last 20 years, most American cities had a renaissance – Detroit did not. Detroit was a train wreck in slow motion for 20 years. The city had unsustainable ﬁnances, corrupt government and a declining population that went from 2 million residents to just over 750,000. It is tragic that this catastrophe had to happen before government started to rectify the situation. We have reported that we are making a huge investment in Detroit, and we are doing this because the leadership – the Democratic mayor and the Republican governor, working with business and nonproﬁt organizations – is taking rational and practical action in Detroit to ﬁx the city’s problems. These leaders talk about strengthening the police, improving schools, bringing jobs back, creating aƯordable housing, ﬁxing streetlights and rehabilitating neighborhoods – real things that actually matter and will help the people of Detroit. They do not couch their agenda in sanctimonious ideology. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These are examples of poor policy at the industry and company level. Under government auspices and with federal government urging, Fannie and Freddie became the largest, most leveraged and most speculative vehicles that the world had ever seen. And when they ﬁnally collapsed, they cost the U.S. government $189 billion. Their actions were a critical part of the failure of the mortgage market, which was at the heart of the Great Recession. Many people spent time trying to ﬁgure out who was to blame more – the banks and mortgage brokers involved or Fannie and Freddie. Here is a better course – each should have acknowledged its mistakes and determined what could have been done better. So yes, public policy is critical to a healthy and functioning economy. Now I’d like to turn my attention to a more forward-looking view of some of the potential risks out there today that are driven by public policy: 49 Our current inability to work together in addressing important, long-term issues. We have spoken many times about the extraordinarily positive and resilient American economy. Today, it is growing stronger, and it is far better than you hear in the current political discourse. But we have serious issues that we need to address – even the United States does not have a divine right to success. I won’t go into a lot of detail but will list only some key concerns: the long-term ﬁscal and tax issues (driven mostly by healthcare and Social Security costs, as well as complex and poorly designed corporate and individual taxes), immigration, education (especially in inner city schools) and the need for good, longterm infrastructure plans. I am not pointing ﬁngers at the government in particular for our inability to act because it is all of us, as U.S. citizens, who need to face these problems. I do not believe that these issues will cause a crisis in the next ﬁve to 10 years, and, unfortunately, this may lull us into a false sense of security. But after 10 years, it will become clear that action will need to be taken. The problem is not that the U.S. economy won’t be able to take care of its citizens – it is that taking away beneﬁts, creating intergenerational warfare and scapegoating will make for very di Ưicult and bad politics. This is a tragedy that we can see coming. Early action would be relatively painless. The potential exit of Britain from the European Union (Brexit). One can reasonably argue that Britain is better untethered to the bureaucratic and sometimes dysfunctional European Union. This may be true in the long run, but let’s analyze the risks. We mostly know what it looks like if Britain stays in the European Union – eƯectively, a continuation of a more predictable environment. But the range of outcomes of a Brexit is large and potentially unknown. The best case is that Britain can quickly renegotiate hundreds of trade and other contracts with countries around the world including the European Union. Even this scenario will result in years of uncertainty, and this uncertainty will hurt the economies of both Britain and the European Union. In a bad scenario, and this is not the worst-case scenario, trade retaliation against Britain by countries in the European Union is possible, even though this would not be in their own self-interest. Retaliation would make things even worse for the British and European economies. And it is hard to determine if the long-run impact would strengthen the European Union or cause it to break apart. The European Union began with a collective resolve to establish a political union and peace after centuries of devastating wars and to create a common market that would result in a better economy and greater prosperity for its citizens. These two goals still exist, and they are still worth striving for. We need a proper public policy response to technology, trade and globalization. Technology and globalization are the best things that ever happened to mankind, but we need to help those left behind. Technology is what has driven progress for all mankind. Without it, we all would be living in tents, hunting buƯalo and hoping to live to age 40. From printing, which resulted in the dissemination of information, to agriculture and to today’s computers and healthcare – it’s an astounding phenomenon – and the next 100 years will be just as astounding. The world and most people beneﬁt enormously from innovative ideas; however, some people, some communities and some sectors in our economy do not. As we embrace progress, we need to recognize that technology and globalization can impact labor markets negatively, create job displacement, and contribute to the pay disparity between the skilled and unskilled. Political and business leaders have fallen short in not only acknowledging these challenges but in dealing with them head on. We need to support solutions that address the displacement of workers and communities through better job training, relocation support and income assistance. Some have suggested that dramatically expanding the earned income tax credit (e Ưectively, paying people to work) may create a healthy and more egalitarian society. Also, we must address an education system that fails millions of young people who live in poor communities throughout the United States. 50 The answer to these challenges is not to hold back progress and the magic of technology; the answer is to deal with the facts and ensure that public policy and public and private enterprise contribute to a healthy, functioning and inclusive economy. At JPMorgan Chase, we are trying to contribute to the debate on public policy. One new way we are doing this is through the development of our JPMorgan Chase Institute, which aims to support sounder economic and public policy through better facts, timely data and thoughtful analysis. Our work at the Institute, whether analyzing income and consumption volatility, small businesses, local spending by consumers or the impact of low gas prices, aims to inform policymakers, businesses and nonproﬁt leaders and help them make smarter decisions to advance global prosperity. What works and what doesn’t work. In my job, I am fortunate to be able to travel around the world and to meet presidents, prime ministers, chief executive o Ưicers, nonproﬁt directors and other inﬂuential civic leaders. All of them want a better future for their country and their people. What I have learned from them is that while politics is hard (in my view, much harder than business), breeding mistrust and misunderstanding makes the political environment far worse. Nearly always, collaboration, rational thinking and analysis make the situation better. Solutions are not always easy to ﬁnd, but they almost always are there. What doesn’t work: • Treating every decision like it is binary – my way or your way. Most decisions are not binary, and there are usually better answers waiting to be found if you do the analysis and involve the right people. • Drawing straw men or creating scapegoats. These generally are subtle attempts to oversimplify someone’s position in order to attack it, resulting in anger, misunderstanding and mistrust. • Denigrating a whole class of people or society. This is always wrong and just another form of prejudice. One of the greatest men in America’s history, President Abraham Lincoln, never drew straw men, never scapegoated and never denigrated any class of society – even though he probably had more reason to do so than many. In the same breath, some of our politicians can extol his virtues while violating them. • Equating perception with reality. This is a tough one because you have to deal with both perceptions and reality. However, perceptions that are real are completely di Ưerent from perceptions that are false. And how you deal with each of them probably should diƯer. • Treating someone’s comments as if they were complaints. When someone’s response to an issue raised is “here they go complaining again,” that reaction diminishes the point of view and also diminishes the person. When a person complains, you need to ask the question: “Are they right or are they wrong?” (If you don’t like the person’s attitude, that is a di Ưerent matter.) What does work: • Collaborating and compromising. They are a necessity in a democracy. Also, you can compromise without violating your principles, but it is nearly impossible to compromise when you turn principles into ideology. • Listening carefully to each other. Make an e Ưort to understand when someone is right and acknowledge it. Each of us should read and listen to great thinkers who have an alternative point of view. • Constantly, openly and thoroughly reviewing institutions, programs and policies. Analyze what is working and what is not working, and then ﬁgure out – together – how we can make it better. 51 I am honored to work at this company and with its outstanding people. What they have accomplished during these often di Ưicult circumstances has been extraordinary. I know that if you could see our people up close in action, you would join me in expressing deep gratitude to them. I am proud to be their partner. IN CLOSING Jamie Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive O Ưicer April 6, 2016 ",
                  "2 Dear Fellow Shareholders, I begin this letter with a sense of gratitude and pride about JPMorgan Chase that has only grown stronger over the course of the last decade. Ours is an exceptional company with an extraordinary heritage and a promising future. Throughout a period of profound political and economic change around the world, our company has been steadfast in our dedication to the clients, communities and countries we serve while earning a fair return for our shareholders. 2016 was another breakthrough year for our company. We earned a record $24.7 billion in net income on revenue1 of $99.1 billion, reﬂecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. We have delivered record results in six out of the last seven years, and we hope to continue to deliver in the future. Our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years. This progress is a function of continually making important investments, in good times and not so good times, to build our capabilities — people, systems and products. These Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive O Ưicer 1 Represents managed revenue 3 investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over ﬁve years, 10 years or since the Bank One/JPMorgan Chase merger (approximately 12 years ago), our stock has signiﬁcantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 and the S&P Financials Index. And this is during a time of unprecedented challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and Stock total return analysis Bank One S&P 500 S&P Financials Index Performance since becoming CEO of Bank One (3/27/2000— 12/31/2016)1 Compounded annual gain 11.5% 4.3% 3.1% Overall gain 524.6% 103.0% 65.9% JPMorgan Chase & Co.

We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/earnings ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated reversal of many negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment, coupled with our sustained, strong business results, are among the reasons our stock price has done so well this past year. As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the value we have created for our shareholders. If we believe our asset and liability values are appropriate — and we do — and if we believe we can continue to deploy this capital at an approximate 15% return on tangible equity, which we do, then our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book value. If you look at the chart below, you’ll see that tangible book value “anchors” the stock price. In the last ﬁve years, we have bought back $25.7 billion in stock. In prior years, I have explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was a nobrainer. While the ﬁrst and most important use of capital is to invest in growth, buying back stock should also be considered when you are generating excess capital.

In this chart, we are looking at heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders.

Five years ago, we o Ưered the example of our buying back stock at tangible book value and having earnings per share and tangible book value per share substantially higher than they otherwise would have been just four years later. While we prefer buying our stock at tangible book value, we think it makes sense to do so at or around two times tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the past. If we buy back a big block of stock this year (using analyst earnings estimates for the next ﬁve years), we would expect earnings per share in ﬁve years to be 3%—4% higher, and tangible book value would be virtually unchanged. In this letter, I discuss the issues highlighted on the next page — which describe many of our successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses. Like last year’s letter, we have organized much of the content around some of the key questions we have received from shareholders and other interested parties. 6 I. The JPMorgan Chase franchise 1. Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading? 2. Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities? 3. What are some technology and ﬁntech initiatives that you’re most excited about? 4. How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them to share data? 5. What are your biggest geopolitical risks? 6. Although banks and other large companies remain unpopular with some people, you often say how proud you are of JPMorgan Chase. Why? II. Regulatory reform 1. Talk about the strength and safety of the ﬁnancial system and whether Too Big to Fail has been solved. 2. How and why should capital rules be changed? 3. How do certain regulatory policies impact money markets? 4. How has regulation a Ưected monetary policy, the ﬂow of bank credit and the growth of the economy? 5. How can we reform mortgage markets to give qualiﬁed borrowers access to the credit they need? 6. How can we reduce complexity and create a more coherent regulatory system? 7. How can we harmonize regulations across the globe? III. Public policy 1. The United States of America is truly an exceptional country. 2. But it is clear that something is wrong — and it’s holding us back. 3. How can we start investing in our people to help them be more productive and share in the opportunities and rewards of our economy? 4. What should our country be doing to invest in its infrastructure? How does the lack of a plan and investment hurt our economy? 5. How should the U.S. legal and regulatory systems be reformed to incentivize investment and job creation? 6. What price are we paying for the lack of understanding about business and free enterprise? 7. Strong collaboration is needed between business and government.

Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading? The chart below and those on page 8 speak for themselves. Looking closely at the actual numbers, it’s clear that every business is among the top performers ﬁnancially – whether you look at e Ưiciency (overhead ratios) or return on equity (ROE) vs. the best in that business. More important, customer satisfaction is at the center of everything we do. Each business has gained market share – which is possible only when you are improving customer satisfaction and your I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRanchise products and services relative to the competition. And each business continues to innovate, from customer-facing apps, to straightthrough processing, to digitized trading services or payment systems. Our business leaders do a great job describing their businesses, and I strongly encourage you to read their letters following this year’s Letter to Shareholders. Each will give you a feel for why we are optimistic about our future.

THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE 2. Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities? We believe we have substantial opportunities in the decades ahead to drive organic growth in our company. We have conﬁdence in the underlying growth in the U.S. and global economies, which will fuel the growth in our customer base – consumer deposits, assets under management and small to large clients globally. This growth will obviously be faster in emerging markets than in developed markets – and we are well-positioned to serve both. In addition, we believe we can continue to gain share in many markets and, over time, add new, relevant products. This can drive organic growth for years. Capturing this growth is very basic: • Selectively adding investment bankers and private bankers around the world • Bringing consumer and commercial banking branches and capabilities to more places in the United States • Adding wholesale branches overseas and carefully expanding into new countries • Adding wholesale and Private Bank clients as they grow into our target space Equally important is using technology and ﬁntech to do a better job serving clients and to grow our businesses – with better products and services. You can read more about our big data, machine learning, payment systems, cybersecurity and electronic trading on pages 47–68 described by our senior executives. But I do want to highlight a few items in the next question that pertain to these topics. 3. What are some technology and ﬁntech initiatives that you’re most excited about? One of the reasons we’re performing well as a company is we never stopped investing in technology – this should never change. In 2016, we spent more than $9.5 billion in technology ﬁrmwide, of which approximately $3 billion is dedicated toward new initiatives. Of that amount, approximately $600 million is spent on emerging ﬁntech solutions – which include building and improving digital and mobile services and partnering with ﬁntech companies. The reasons we invest so much in technology (whether it’s digital, big data or machine learning) are simple: to beneﬁt customers with better, faster and often cheaper products and services, to reduce errors and to make the ﬁrm more e Ưicient. We are developing great new products. We are currently developing some exciting new products and services, which we will be adding to our suite and rolling out later this year, including: • End-to-end digital banking – The ability to open an account and complete the majority of transactions on a mobile phone. • Investment advice and selfdirected investing – Online vehicles for both individual retirement and non-retirement accounts, providing easy-to-use (and inexpensive) automated advice, as well as enabling our customers to buy and sell stocks and bonds, etc. (again inexpensively). • Electronic trading and other online services (e.g., cash management) in our Corporate & Investment Bank and Asset & Wealth Management businesses – OƯering our clients a more robust digital platform. 10 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE We are investing in data and technology to improve the ﬁnancial health of low-income households. Over the last two years, the JPMorgan Chase Institute has helped identify some of the most pressing ﬁnancial challenges facing American households, such as their di Ưiculty managing income and expense volatility. We are using that data to select and support innovative ﬁntech companies and nonproﬁts that are designing solutions to address these challenges. One example of these e Ưorts is JPMorgan Chase’s Financial Solutions Lab, which, in partnership with the Center for Financial Services Innovation, seeks to facilitate the next generation of ﬁntech products to help consumers manage their daily ﬁnances and meet their long-term goals. Highlights of the initiative include: • To date, the Lab has helped support more than 18 ﬁntech companies working to improve the ﬁnancial health of more than 1 million Americans. One example is Digit, an automated savings tool that identiﬁes small amounts of money that can be moved into savings based on spending and income. To date, it has helped Americans save more than $350 million. • Lab winners have raised more than $100 million in follow-on capital. • In 2017, we launched a new competition seeking innovative ﬁntech solutions to promote the ﬁnancial health of populations often overlooked, such as people of color, individuals with disabilities and lowincome women. We are successfully collaborating with other companies to deliver ﬁntech solutions. Whether it is consumer payment systems (Zelle), mortgages (Roostify), auto ﬁnance (TrueCar), small business lending (OnDeck Capital) or communications systems (Symphony), we are successfully collaborating with some excellent ﬁntech companies to dramatically improve our digital and other customer o Ưerings. I’d like to highlight just two new exciting areas: • Developer Services API store – By providing direct interfaces with our applications (fully controlled, of course), we are enabling entrepreneurs, partners, ﬁntech companies and clients to build new products or services dedicated to speciﬁc needs. • Bill payment and business services – While I can’t reveal much at the moment, su Ưice it to say there are some interesting developments coming as we integrate our capabilities with those of other companies. 4. How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them to share data? For years, we have been describing the risks – to banks and customers – that arise when customers freely give away their bank passcodes to third-party services, allowing virtually unlimited access to their data. Customers often do not know the liability this may create for them, if their passcode is misused, and, in many cases, they do not realize how their data are being used. For example, access to the data may continue for years after customers have stopped using the third-party services. We recently completed a new arrangement with Intuit, which we think represents an important step forward. In addition to protecting the bank, the customers and even the third party (in this case, Intuit), it allows customers to share data – how and when they want. Under this arrangement, customers can choose whatever they would like to share and opting to turn these selections on or o Ư as they see ﬁt. The data will be “pushed” to Intuit, eliminating the need for sharing bank passcodes, which protects the bank and our customers and reduces potential liabilities on Intuit’s part as well. We are hoping this sets a new standard for data-sharing relationships. 11 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE 5. What are your biggest geopolitical risks? Banks have to manage a lot of risks – from credit and trading risks to technological, operational, conduct and cybersecurity risks. But in addition to those, we have exposures around the world, which are subject to normal cyclical and recession risks, as well as to complex geopolitical risks. There are always geopolitical risks, and you can rest assured we are continuously reviewing, analyzing and stress testing them to ensure that our company can endure them. We always try to make certain that we can handle the worst of all cases – importantly, without disrupting the e Ưective operation of the company and its service to our clients. We think these geopolitical risks currently are in a heightened state – that is, beyond what we might consider normal. There are two speciﬁc risks I want to point out: Brexit and the increasing risk to the European Union (EU). Regarding Brexit, a key concern is to make sure our company is prepared to support our clients on day one – the ﬁrst day after the actual Brexit occurs, approximately two years from now. We are conﬁdent we will be able to develop and expand the capabilities that our EU subsidiaries and branches will need to serve our clients properly in Europe under EU law. This will require acquiring regulatory approvals, transferring certain technologies and moving some people. On day one, we need to perform all of our critical functions at our standards. For example, underwriting debt and equity, moving money and accepting deposits, and safeguarding the custody assets for all of our European clients, including many sovereigns themselves. We must be prepared to do this assuming a hard exit by the United Kingdom – it would be irresponsible to presume otherwise. While this does not entail moving many people in the next two years, we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to “outsource” services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries. We hope that the advent of Brexit would lead the EU to focus on ﬁxing its issues – immigration, bureaucracy, the ongoing loss of sovereign rights and labor inﬂexibility – and thereby pulling the EU and the monetary union closer together. Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart. The unraveling of the EU and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political e Ưects. While we are not predicting this will happen, the probabilities have certainly gone up – and we will keep a close eye on the situation in Europe over the next several years. De-globalization, Mexico and China. Anti-globalization sentiment is growing in parts of the world today, usually expressing itself in anti-trade and antiimmigration positions. (I’m not going to write about immigration in this letter – we have always supported proper immigration – it is a vital part of the strength of America, and, properly done, it enhances the economy and the vitality of the country.) We do not believe globalization will reverse course – we believe trade has been absolutely critical for growth around the world and has beneﬁted billions of people. While there are some issues with our trade policies that need to be ﬁxed, poorly conceived anti-trade policies could be quite disruptive, particularly with two of our key trading partners: Mexico and China. The trade deal with Mexico through NAFTA is simpler than the one with China. (In full disclosure, JPMorgan Chase is a major international bank in Mexico, with revenue of more than $400 million, serving Mexican, American and international clients who do business there.) Mexico is a long-standing peaceful neighbor, and it is wholly in our country’s interest that Mexico be a prosperous nation. This actually reduces immigration issues (there are now more Mexicans 12 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE going back to Mexico than coming into the United States). Our trade agreement with Mexico helps ensure that the young democracy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti-American leaders (like Chavez did in Venezuela). While there are some clear, identiﬁable problems with NAFTA, I believe they will be worked out in a way that is fair and beneﬁcial for both sides. The logic to do so is completely compelling. China is far more complex. (Again, in full disclosure, we have a major international presence in China, with revenue of approximately $700 million, serving Chinese, American and international clients who do business in that country.) The United States has some serious trade issues with China, which have grown over the years – from cybersecurity and the protection of intellectual property to tari Ưs, non-tariƯ trade barriers and non-fulﬁllment of World Trade Organization obligations. However, there is no inevitable or compelling reason that China and America have to clash – in fact, improving political and economic relationships can be good for both parties. So while the issues here are not easy, I am hopeful they can be resolved in a way that is fair and constructive for the two countries. 6. Although banks and other large companies remain unpopular with some people, you often say how proud you are of JPMorgan Chase. Why? I ﬁrmly believe the qualities embedded in JPMorgan Chase today – the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our deep client relationships, our technology, our strategic thinking and our global presence – cannot be replicated. While we take nothing for granted, as long as we continue to do our jobs well and continue to drive our company forward, we think we can be a leader for our industry and the communities we serve for decades to come. There are times when I am bursting with pride with what we have accomplished for our clients, communities and countries around the world – let me count (some of) the ways: We are strong and steadfast and are there for our clients in good times and bad. In the toughest of times, we maintained a healthy and vibrant company that was able to do its job – we did not need government support and, in fact, we consistently provided credit and capital to our clients and assistance to our government throughout the crisis. I want to remind our shareholders that we continued to lend not at the much higher prevailing market rates at that time but at existing bank rates. These were far below market rates because our clients relied on us – we were their lender of last resort. JPMorgan Chase was and will be a Rock of Gibraltar in the best and worst of times for our clients around the world. 13 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE We have extraordinary capabilities — both our people and our technology. Ultimately, our people are our most important assets – and they are exceptional. Their knowledge, their capabilities and their relationships are what drive everything else, including our technology and our innovation. They partner well with each other around the world, and they are deeply trusted by our clients and within our communities. We all owe them an enormous debt. They are the ones accomplishing all the things you are reading about in this Annual Report. Our fortress balance sheet and the strength of our people were never more vividly evident than during the darkest hours of the ﬁnancial crisis.

THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE to acquire and assimilate Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual – thereby saving 30,000 jobs and avoiding the devastation of communities that would have happened if those companies had been allowed to fail. Our company went above and beyond the call of duty during the height of the crisis, including lending $87 billion to a bankrupt Lehman to facilitate, as much as possible, an orderly unwind of its assets. In those dark days, we were the only bank willing to commit to lending $4 billion to the state of California, $2 billion to the state of New Jersey and $1 billion to the state of Illinois to keep those states strong. None of these actions had to be taken, and they were made at some risk to JPMorgan Chase. We simply were acting to do our part to try to stop the crisis from getting worse. We try to be outstanding corporate citizens. We believe in being great corporate citizens – in how we treat our employees and care for our clients and communities. Let me give some examples to illustrate this point: • We compensate our employees fairly and provide extraordinary beneﬁts and training. We value our employees at JPMorgan Chase, and we are committed to helping them succeed. This past year, we announced that we will increase our minimum wages – mostly for entry-level bank tellers and customer service representatives – to between $12.00 and $16.50 an hour (depending on where these employees live). This will increase wages for approximately 18,000 employees. We believe this pay increase is the right thing to do, and, above all, it enables more people to begin to share in the rewards Assets Entrusted to Us by Our Clients at December 31, ($ in billions) 1 Represents assets under management, as well as custody, brokerage, administration and deposit accounts. 2 Represents activities associated with the safekeeping and servicing of assets.

THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE of our success. Remember, many of these employees soon move on to even higher paying jobs. We will also continue to invest in employee beneﬁts and training opportunities so that our workers can continue to increase their skills and advance their careers. Our comprehensive beneﬁts package, including healthcare and retirement savings, on average, is valued at $11,000 per year. Our total investment in training and development is approximately $325 million a year. Together, these eƯorts help our employees support their families, advance their careers and promote economic growth in our communities. • We have a diverse workforce. We have more than 243,000 employees globally with over 167,000 in the United States. Women represent 50% of our employees. Recently, Oliver Wyman, a leading global management consulting ﬁrm, issued a report stating that it would be 30 years before women reach 30% Executive Committee representation within global ﬁnancial services. So you might be surprised to ﬁnd out that women already represent 30% of my direct reports and approximately 30% of our company’s senior leadership globally. They run major businesses – several units on their own would be among Fortune 1000 companies. In addition to having three women on our Operating Committee – who run Asset & Wealth Management, Finance and Legal – some of our other businesses and functions headed by women include Consumer Banking, Credit Card, U.S. Private Bank, U.S. Mergers & Acquisitions, Global Equity Capital Markets, Global Research, Regulatory A Ưairs, Global Philanthropy, our U.S. branch network, our Controller and ﬁrmwide Marketing. I believe we have some of the best women leaders in the corporate world globally. In addition to gender diversity, 48% of our ﬁrm’s population is ethnically diverse in the United States, and we are in more than 60 countries around the world. Diversity means running a company where people are respected, trusted and given equal opportunity to contribute and raise their ideas and voices. But there is one area in particular where we simply have not met the standards JPMorgan Chase has set for itself – and that is in increasing African-American talent at the ﬁrm. While we think our eƯort to attract and retain black talent is as good as at most other companies, it simply is not good enough. Therefore, in 2016, we introduced a new ﬁrmwide initiative called Advancing Black Leaders. This initiative is dedicated to helping us better attract and recruit external black talent while retaining and developing the talent within the company. And we are proud of our e Ưorts this past year – we increased the number of black employees at the o Ưicer level (through both internal promotions and external new hires), we focused on the pipeline of junior talent, and we increased the number at the senior oƯicer and vice president level. We plan to continue to make progress on this front in the years to come. • We are proud of how we are helping veterans. We want to continue to update you on how JPMorgan Chase has helped position military members, veterans and their families. Our program is centered on facilitating success in their post-service lives primarily through employment and retention. In 2011, JPMorgan Chase and 10 other companies launched the 100,000 Jobs Mission, setting a goal of collectively hiring 100,000 veterans. The initiative now includes more than 200 companies, has collectively hired nearly 400,000 veterans, and is focused on collectively hiring 1 million people. JPMorgan Chase alone has hired more than 11,000 veterans since 2011. We hope you feel as good about this initiative as we do. • We have accomplished an extraordinary amount in our Corporate Responsibility e Ưorts. We take this responsibility very seriously, and, over the last decade, not only have we more than doubled our philanthropic giving from approximately 16 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE $100 million to approximately $250 million in 2016, but we have dramatically increased our support with human capital, collaboration, data and management expertise. Our head of Corporate Responsibility talks about our signiﬁcant measures in more detail in his letter, but I will highlight two initiatives below: − We provide tremendous support to cities and communities – especially those left behind – and the best example is our work in Detroit. JPMorgan Chase has been doing business in Detroit for more than 80 years, and we watched as this iconic American city was engulfed in economic turmoil after years of decline. Just as Detroit was declaring bankruptcy, our company redoubled its e Ưorts to help and, in 2014, announced our most comprehensive initiative to date – a $100 million investment in Detroit to help accelerate the city’s recovery. We are making strategic, coordinated investments focused on creating economically inclusive and revitalized neighborhoods, preparing people with the skills needed for today’s high-quality jobs and providing small businesses with the capital they need to grow and succeed. This includes our investment in the Strategic Neighborhoods Fund, which brings together community developers and dedicated resources to create and maintain a Ưordable housing and deliver services to targeted communities. We also seeded the city’s ﬁrst nonproﬁt real estate development ﬁrm focused exclusively on creating and preserving a Ưordable housing in Detroit’s neighborhoods. In 2015, we helped create the $6.5 million Entrepreneurs of Color Fund with the Kellogg Foundation and Detroit Development Fund to bring critical ﬁnancing and technical assistance to underserved minority- and community-based small businesses. In its ﬁrst year, the Fund deployed almost $3 million in capital through more than 30 loans. We are also putting our talented employees to work in Detroit through the Detroit Service Corps. Since 2014, 68 JPMorgan Chase employees from 10 countries dedicated three intensive weeks to 16 Detroit nonproﬁts, helping them analyze challenges, solve problems and improve their chances for success. Detroit is making incredible progress as a result of the unprecedented spirit of engagement and cooperation among the city’s leaders, business community and nonproﬁt sectors. JPMorgan Chase is proud to be part of Detroit’s resurgence, and we believe a thriving Detroit economy will become a shining example of American resilience and ingenuity at work. − And more broadly, we created solutions for one of our country’s biggest challenges – training the world’s workforce in the skills needed to compete in today’s economy. Through several targeted initiatives, JPMorgan Chase is investing over $325 million in demanddriven workforce development initiatives around the world. Our programs build stronger labor markets that create economic opportunity, focusing on middle-skill jobs – positions that require a high school education, and often specialized training or certiﬁcations, but not a college degree. These jobs – surgical technologists, diesel mechanics, help desk technicians and more – oƯer good wages and the chance to move up the economic ladder. Our goal is to increase the number of workers who have access to career pathways, whether they are adults looking to develop new skills or younger workers starting to prepare for careers during high school and ending with postsecondary degrees or credentials aligned with good-paying, high-demand jobs. We are very proud that we can be a bridge between businesses and job seekers to support an economy that creates opportunity for everyone. 17 II. We had a severe ﬁnancial crisis followed by needed reform, and our ﬁnancial system is now stronger and more resilient as a result. During and since the crisis, we’ve always supported thoughtful, e Ưective regulation, not simply more or less. But it is an understatement to say improvements could be made. The regulatory environment is unnecessarily complex, costly and sometimes confusing. No rational person could think that everything that was done was good, fair, sensible and e Ưective, or coherent and consistent in creating a safer and stronger system. We believe (and many studies show) that poorly conceived and uncoordinated regulations have damaged our economy, inhibiting growth and jobs – and this has hurt the average American. We are not looking to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules (many of which were not speciﬁcally prescribed in DoddFrank). It is, however, appropriate to open up the rulebook in the light of day and rework the rules and regulations that don’t work well or are unnecessary. Rest assured, we will be responsibly and reasonably engaged on this front. We believe changes can and should be made that preserve the safety and soundness of the ﬁnancial system and lead to a more healthy and vibrant economy for the beneﬁt of all. There are some basic principles that should guide responsible regulation: • Coherence of rules to be coordinated both within and across regulatory agencies • Global harmonization of regulation to enhance fair trade and competition while helping eliminate any weak links in the global system • Simpliﬁed and proper risk-based capital standards • Consistent and transparent capital and liquidity rules • Regular and rigorous regulatory review, including consideration of costs vs. beneﬁts, e Ưiciencies, competitiveness, reduction of redundant costs and assessment of impact on economic growth Adhering to these principles will maximize safety and soundness, increase competition and improve economic health. Since the ﬁnancial crisis, thousands of new rules and regulations have been put into place by multiple regulators in the United States and around the world. An already complex system of ﬁnancial oversight and supervision has grown even more complex – and this complexity can sometimes create even more risk. Many of these rules and regulations should be examined and possibly modiﬁed, but I will focus on the few that are critical in response to some of the questions and topics that follow. Regulatory Reform 18 II. Regulatory Reform 1. Talk about the strength and safety of the ﬁnancial system and whether Too Big to Fail has been solved. There is no question that the system is safer and stronger today, and this is mostly due to the following factors: • Dramatically higher capital for almost all banks (we’ll talk later about how much capital is the appropriate amount) • Far higher liquidity for almost all banks (again, we’ll provide more details later in this section) • More disclosure and transparency – both to investors and regulators • More coordinated oversight within the United States and abroad • Far stronger compliance and control systems • Laws that allow regulators to step in to unwind not only failing banks but investment banks (this did not exist for investment banks prior to the ﬁnancial crisis) • The creation of “bail-inable” unsecured debt – this converts debt into equity at the time of failure, immediately recapitalizing the failed bank • New rules that prohibit derivatives contracts from being voided at bankruptcy – this allows derivatives contracts to stay in place, creating an orderly transition to bankruptcy • Stress testing that monitors banks’ balance sheets and capital ratios under severely adverse scenarios (more on this below) • Requirements for banks and investment banks to prepare corporate recovery plans in the event of a crisis to prevent bankruptcy (these plans did not exist before the ﬁnancial crisis) These changes taken together not only largely eliminate the chance of a major bank failing today but also prevent such failure from having a threatening domino e Ưect on other banks and the economy as a whole. And if a major bank does fail, regulators have the necessary tools to manage it in an orderly way. Moreover, the banking industry itself has an inherent interest in the safety and soundness of the ﬁnancial system because if there is a failure, the entire industry will be liable for that cost (more on that below). Essentially, Too Big to Fail has been solved — taxpayers will not pay if a bank fails. The American public has the right to demand that if a major bank fails, they, as taxpayers, would not have to pay for it, and the failure wouldn’t unduly harm the U.S. economy. In my view, these demands have now both been met. On the ﬁrst count, if a bank fails, taxpayers do not pay. Shareholders and debtholders, now due to total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) rules, are at risk for all losses. To add belts and suspenders, if all that capital is not enough, the next and ﬁnal line of defense is the industry itself, which is legally liable to pay any excess losses. (Notably, since 20o7, JPMorgan Chase alone has contributed $11.7 billion to the industry deposit fund.) On the second count, a regulatory takeover of a major bank would be orderly because regulators have the tools to manage it in the right way. It is instructive to look at what would happen if Lehman were to fail in today’s regulatory regime. First of all, it is highly unlikely the ﬁrm would fail because the new requirements would mean that instead of Lehman’s equity capital being $23 billion, which it was in 2007, it would be approximately $45 billion under today’s capital rules. In addition, Lehman would have far stronger 19 II. Regulatory Reform liquidity and “bailinable” debt. And ﬁnally, the ﬁrm would be forced to raise capital much earlier in the process. If Lehman failed anyway, regulators would now have the legal authority to put the ﬁrm in receivership (they did not have that ability back in 2007–2008). The moment that happened, unsecured debt of approximately $120 billion would be immediately converted to equity. Derivatives contracts would not be triggered, and cash would continue to move through the pipes of the ﬁnancial system. In other words, due to the living wills, Too Big to Fail was solved before any additional rules were put in place. (I’m not going to go into detail on the living wills but will say that while they have some positive elements, they have become unnecessarily complex and costly, and they need to be simpliﬁed.) Last, there is a new push for Chapter 14 bankruptcy for banks, which we at JPMorgan Chase support. This would provide specialized rules to quickly handle bankruptcy for banks. Whether a failed bank goes through Chapter 14, called “bankruptcy,” or Title II, called “resolution” – these are essentially the same thing – we should make the following point perfectly clear to the American people: A failed bank means the bank’s board and management are discharged, its equity is worthless, compensation is clawed back to the extent of the law and the bank’s name will forever be buried in the Hall of Shame. In addition, we should change the term “resolution” – as it sounds as if we are bailing out a failing bank (which couldn’t be further from the truth). Whatever the term is called, it should be made clear that the process is the same as bankruptcy in any other industry. One lesson from the prior crisis is that the American public will not be satisﬁed without “Old Testament Justice.” But market panic will never disappear entirely, and regulations must be ﬂexible enough to allow banks to act as a bulwark against it rather than forcing ﬁnancial institutions into a defensive crouch that will only make things worse. There will be market panic again, and it won’t a Ưect just banks – it will aƯect the entire ﬁnancial marketplace. Remember, banks were consistent providers of credit at existing prices into the crisis – the market was not. During the crisis, many companies could not raise money in the public markets, many securities did not trade, securities issuances dropped dramatically and many asset prices fell to valuation levels that virtually anticipated a Great Depression. Last time around, banks – in particular (and I say with pride) our bank – stood by their customers to provide capital and liquidity that helped them survive. However, today’s capital and liquidity rules have created rigidity that will actually hurt banks’ ability to stand against the tide as they did during the Great Recession. This will mean that banks will survive the next market panic with plenty of cushion that could have been – but may not have been – used to help customers, companies and communities. It is in this environment that regulators need certain authorities to stop the situation from getting worse. One important point: Under both Chapter 14 and Title II, there might be a short-term need for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Fed to lend money, in the short run with proper collateral, to a failing or failed institution. This is because panic can cause a run on the bank, and it is far less painful to the economy if that bank’s assets are not sold in ﬁre sales. This lending is e Ưectively fully secured, and no loss should ever be incurred. Again, any loss that did occur would be charged back to all the banks. This also gives banks an enormous incentive to be in favor of a properly designed, safe and sound system. Going back to the principles above, putting safety and soundness ﬁrst is clearly correct, but regulators also need the ability to take into consideration the costs and impact on our economy in various scenarios. 20 II. Regulatory Reform 2. How and why should capital rules be changed? We need consistent, transparent, simpliﬁed and more risk-based capital standards. A healthy banking system needs consistent and transparent capital and liquidity rules that are based on simpliﬁed and proper risk-based standards. This allows banks to use capital intelligently and to properly plan capital levels over the years. Any rules that are capricious or that cause an arbitrary reduction in the value of a bank’s capital – and the value of the bank overall – can cause improper or ine Ưicient risk taking. Finally, proper capital rules will allow a bank to do its job: to consistently ﬁnance the economy, in good times and, importantly, in bad times. There are more than 20 diƯerent major capital and liquidity requirements – and they often are inconsistent. For example, certain liquidity rules force a bank to hold an increasing amount of cash, essentially deposited at the Fed, but other rules require the bank to hold capital against this risk-free cash. An extraordinary number of calculations need to be made as companies try to manage to avoid inadvertently violating one of the standards – a violation that rarely a Ưects safety and soundness. To protect themselves, banks build enormous bu Ưers – and buƯers on top of bu Ưers – or otherwise take unnecessary actions to ensure that they don’t step over the line. And ﬁnally, if we Our Fortress Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008 2016 CET1 7.0%3 12.2%4 TCE/ Total assets1 4.0% 7.5% Tangible common equity $84B $183B Total assets $2.2T $2.5T RWA $1.2T3 $1.5T4 Operational risk RWA $0 $400B Liquidity ~$300B $786B Fed funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements $193B $166B Long-term debt and preferred stock2 $303B $321B 1 Excludes goodwill and intangible assets.

We have a fortress balance sheet — far more than the numbers imply. The chart on page 20 shows the dramatic improvement in our capital and liquidity numbers since 2008. Remember, we had enough capital and liquidity in 2008 to easily handle the crisis that ensued. The numbers are even better than they look on the chart for the following reasons: • In 2008, there was no such thing as operational risk capital (not to say there wasn’t operational risk but just that capital was not applied to it). If you measured our capital ratio on the same basis as in 2008 (that is, on an apples to apples basis), we wouldn’t have just 12.2% today vs. 7% in 2008 – we would have 16.7% today vs. 7% in 2008. • Since 2008, the regulatory deﬁnition of liquidity has been prescribed. Now, only deposits at a central bank, Treasuries and government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (plus a limited amount of sovereign and corporate bonds) count as liquidity. Many securities are not allowed to count as liquidity today – on the theory that they can sustain losses and occasionally become illiquid. While maybe not all 100% of the current value of these securities should apply toward liquidity requirements, they should count for something. If you did combine all of these categories as liquidity, our liquidity at JPMorgan Chase would have gone from $300 billion in 2008 to $786 billion today. And remember, our deposits – theoretically subject to “run on the bank” risk – total $1.4 trillion. Even in the Great Recession, the worst case for a bank was only a 30% loss of its deposits. • Finally, when you include long-term debt and preferred stock as loss absorbing capital, our total capital2 is approximately $500 billion vs. true risk-weighted assets of $1.1 trillion.3 Essentially, since 2008, our total capital has gone from $387 billion to $500 billion, while actual risk-weighted assets have declined to $1.1 trillion. In addition to our fortress balance sheet, we are well-diversiﬁed, and we have healthy margins and strong controls. These are all factors that dramatically improve safety and soundness, but they are not included in any measures. As you will see below, we can handle almost any stress. We believe in stress testing, but it could be improved and simpliﬁed. As you know, the Fed puts our company through one “severely adverse” stress test annually, which determines how we can use our capital, pay dividends, buy back stock and expand. We are great believers in stress testing but would like to make the following points: • Our shareholders should know that we don’t rely on one stress test a year – we conduct more than 200 each week across all of our riskiest exposures. We meet weekly; we analyze each exposure in multiple ways; we are extremely risk conscious. • The Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test estimates what our losses would be through a severely adverse event lasting over nine quarters, which approximates the severity and time of the Great Recession; e.g., high unemployment, counterparty failures, etc. The Fed estimates that in such a scenario, we would lose $31 billion over the ensuing nine quarters, which is easily manageable by JPMorgan Chase’s capital base. My own view is that we would make money in almost every quarter in that type of environment, and this is supported by our having earned approximately $30 billion pre-tax over the course of the nine quarters during the real ﬁnancial crisis. 22 II. Regulatory Reform We don’t completely understand the Fed’s assumptions and models – the Fed does not share them with us (we hope there will be more transparency and clarity in the future). But we do understand that the Fed’s stress test shows results far worse than our own test because the Fed’s stress test is not a forecast of what you actually think will happen. Instead, it appropriately makes additional assumptions about a company’s likelihood to fail – that its trading losses will be far worse than expected, etc. The Fed wants to make sure the bank has enough capital if just about everything goes wrong. Finally, while we ﬁrmly believe banks should have a proper assessment of their qualitative abilities, this should not be part of a onceayear stress test. Instead, it should be part of the Fed’s regular exam process. The Fed and the banks should work together to continuously improve the quality of their processes while creating a consistent, safe and economy-growing use of capital. It is clear that the banks have too much capital. Here is another critical point: The Fed’s stress test of the 33 major banks estimates what each bank would lose assuming it were the worst bank in the crisis, which, of course, will not be true in the real world. But even if that happened, the chart below shows that if you combine all the banks’ extreme losses, the total losses add up to less than 10% of the banks’ combined capital. This deﬁnitively proves that there is excess capital in the system. And more of that capital can be safely used to ﬁnance the economy. Proper calibration of capital is critical to ensure not only that the system is safe and sound but that banks can use their capital to ﬁnance the economy. And we think it’s clear that banks can use more of their capital to ﬁnance the economy without sacriﬁcing safety and soundness. Had they been less afraid of potential CCAR stress losses, banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower rated middle market loans and near-prime mortgages. 1 Includes 2013’s 18 participating CCAR banks as well as Bear Stearns, Countrywide, Merrill Lynch, National City, Wachovia and Washington Mutual.

Regulatory Reform The global systemically important bank (GSIB) and supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) rules need to be modiﬁed. The GSIB capital surcharge forces large banks to add even more capital, based on some very complex calculations that are highly ﬂawed and not risk based. In fact, the rules often penalize fairly risk-free activity, such as deposits held at the Fed and short-term secured ﬁnancing. Likewise, the SLR rules force capital to be held on deposit at the Fed in Treasury securities and in other liquid securities. Neither calculation gives credit for operating margins, diversiﬁcation or annuity streams of business. These calculations should, at a minimum, be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed and balanced to promote lending and other policy goals, including maintaining deep and liquid capital markets, clearing derivatives and directing more private capital in the mortgage market. Operational risk capital should be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed, if not eliminated. No one could credibly argue that there is no such thing as operational risk, separate and distinct from credit and market risk. All businesses have operational risk (trucks crash, computers fail, lawsuits happen, etc.), but almost all businesses successfully manage it through their operating earnings and general resources. Basel standards required banks to hold capital for operational risk, and the United States “gold plated” this calculation. Banks in the United States in total now hold approximately $200 billion in operational risk capital. For us, we hold excess operational risk capital which is not being utilized to support our economy. It was an unnecessarily large add-on. If you are going to have operational risk capital, it should be forward looking, fairly calculated, coordinated with other capital rules and consistent with reality. (Currently, if you exit a business that created operational risk capital, you are still, most likely, required to hold the operational risk capital.) Finally, America should eliminate its “gold plating” of international standards. American regulators took the new Basel standards across a wide variety of calculations and asked for more. If JPMorgan Chase could use the same international standards as other international banks, it would free up a material amount of capital. The removal of the GSIB surcharge “gold plating” alone would free up $15 billion of equity capital – an amount that could support almost $190 billion of loans. In addition, America gold plated operational risk capital, liquidity rules, SLR rules and TLAC rules. Later in this letter, we will discuss international standards. Properly done and improved, modifying many of these regulatory standards could help ﬁnance the growth of the American economy without damaging the safety and soundness of the system. 3. How do certain regulatory policies impact money markets? Di Ưerent from most banks, money center banks help large institutions – including governments, investors and large money market funds – move short-term funds around the system to where those funds are needed most. The recipients of these funds include ﬁnancial institutions (including nonmoney center banks) and corporations that can have large daily needs to invest or borrow. The products that money center banks o Ưer large institutions are predominantly deposits, securities, money market funds and shortterm overnight investments called repurchase agreements. These involve enormous ﬂows of funds, which money center banks handle easily, carefully and securely. They are generally match-funded4 , almost no credit risk is taken, and most lending is done wholly and properly secured by Treasuries or government-guaranteed securities. These transactions represent a large part of JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet. Because of new rules, capital in many cases must be held on these short-term, virtually riskless activities, and we believe this has caused distortions in the marketplace. For example: 4 Match-funding ensures that the risk characteristics — e.g., interest rate, maturity — of the asset (e.g., loan) are o Ưset by the liability (e.g., deposit) funding it. 24 II. Regulatory Reform • Swap spreads, for the ﬁrst time in history, turned negative, which means that corporations need to pay a lot more to hedge their interest rate exposure. • Reduction in broker-dealer inventories has impacted liquidity. • Many banks reject certain types of large deposits from some of their large institutional clients. In a peculiar twist of fate – and something di Ưicult for our clients to understand – through 2016, JPMorgan Chase turned away 3,200 large clients and $200 billion of their deposits even though we could have taken them without incurring any risk whatsoever (we simply would have deposited the $200 billion at the central bank). The charts below shows some of the reduction in banks’ market-making abilities. We need to work closely with regulators to assess the impact of the new rules on speciﬁc markets, the cost and volatility of liquidity, and the potential cost of credit. We should be able to make some modest changes that in no way impact safety and soundness but improve markets. 4. How has regulation a Ưected monetary policy, the ﬂow of bank credit and the growth of the economy? It is extremely important that we analyze how new capital and liquidity rules aƯect the creation of credit; i.e., lending. We have yet to see thorough, thoughtful analysis on this subject by economists – because in this case, it is very hard to calculate what might have been counterfactual. However, it seems clear that if banks had been able to use more of their capital and liquidity, they would have been more aggressive in terms of expanding: Think of additional bankers, bank branches and geographies, which likely would have led to additional lending. (On the following pages, we make it clear that this would have been the case in mortgage lending.) I would like to focus on how liquidity policies may have impacted the e Ưectiveness of monetary policy and lending. The chart on page 25 shows bank loans vs. bank deposits from 2006 to 2016. During the last several decades, deposits and loans were mostly balanced. You can see that stopped being true after the start of the Great Recession. Today, loans are approximately $2 trillion less than deposits.

Regulatory Reform Many factors may inﬂuence this scenario, but there are two arguments at the bookends about why this happened: • There was simply not enough loan demand due to a slow-growing economy. • The new liquidity rules require banks to hold approximately $2 trillion at the Federal Reserve, whether or not there is loan demand. It is evident that banks reduced certain types of lending legitimately – think of some of the inappropriate subprime mortgage lending – but banks cut back on other types of lending as well because of the new rules; for example, small business lending due to CCAR and cross-border lending because of GSIB. The ensuing discussion shows how other regulatory rules dramatically decreased mortgage lending, again slowing down the economy. It is clear that the transmission of monetary policy is di Ưerent today from what it was in the past because of new capital and liquidity rules. What is not clear is how much these rules reduced lending. Again, working together, we should be able to ﬁgure it out and make appropriate improvements that enhance economic growth without damaging the safety of the system. 5. How can we reform mortgage markets to give qualiﬁed borrowers access to the credit they need? Much of what we consider good in America – a good job, stability and community involvement – is represented in the achievement of homeownership. Owning a home is still the embodiment of the American Dream, and it is commonly the most important asset that most families have. So it is no surprise the ﬁnancial crisis, which was caused in part by poor mortgage lending practices and which caused so much pain for American families and businesses, led to new regulations and enhanced supervision. We needed to create a safer and better functioning mortgage industry.

Regulatory Reform housing sector has been unusually slow to recover, and that may be partly due to restrictions in mortgage credit. Seven major federal regulators and a long list of state and local regulators have overlapping jurisdiction on mortgage laws and wrote a plethora of new rules and regulations appropriately focused on educating and protecting customers. While some of the rules are beneﬁcial, many were hastily developed and layered upon existing rules without coordination or calibration as to the potential e Ưects. The result is a complex, highly risky and unpredictable operating environment that exposes lenders and servicers to disproportionate legal liability and materially increases operational risks and costs. These actions resulted in: • Mortgages that cost the consumer more • A tightening credit box; i.e., mortgage lenders are less likely to extend credit to borrowers without a strong credit history • An inhibition of the return of private capital to the housing industry • The crowding out of resources to improve technology and the customer experience The chart below and the top chart on page 27 show the decline in lending to individuals with lower credit scores.

As I look back on last year — in fact, the last decade — it is remarkable how well our company has performed. And I’m not only talking about our strong ﬁnancial performance — but also about how much we have accomplished to help our clients, customers and communities all around the world. Ours is an exceptional company with an extraordinary heritage and a promising future. We continue to make excellent progress around technology, risk and controls, innovation, diversity and reduced bureaucracy.

In this chart, we are looking at heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share; it is an after-tax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number with dividends reinvested. 1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One. 4 In the last ﬁve years, we have bought back nearly $40 billion in stock. In prior years, I explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was a no- brainer. Six years ago, we o Ưered an example of this, with earnings per share and tangible book value per share being substantially higher than they otherwise would have been just four years later. While we prefer buying back our stock at tangible book value, we think it makes sense to do so even at or above two times tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the past. If we buy back a big block of stock this year, we would expect (using analyst earnings estimates for the next ﬁve years) earnings per share in ﬁve years to be 2%—3% higher and tangible book value to be virtually unchanged. As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the value we have created for our shareholders. If our asset and liability values are appropriate — and we believe they are — and if we can continue to deploy this capital proﬁtably, we now think that it can earn approximately 17% return on tangible equity for the foreseeable future. Then, in our view, our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book value. The chart on the bottom of page 3 shows that tangible book value “anchors” the stock price.

Buying back stock should only be considered when we either cannot invest (sometimes that’s a function of regulatory policies) or when we are generating excess, unusable capital. We currently have excess capital, but due to recent tax reform and a more constructive regulatory environment, we hope, in the future, to use more of our excess capital to grow our businesses, expand into new markets and support our employees. Our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years. This progress is a function of continually making important investments, in good times and not-so-good times, to build our capabilities — people, systems and products. These investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over ﬁve years, 10 years or since the Bank One/JPMorgan Chase merger (approximately 13 years ago), our stock has signiﬁcantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) and the S&P Financials Index. And this growth came during a time of unprecedented challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and the 6 extraordinarily di Ưicult legal, regulatory and political environment that followed. We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/ earnings ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated reversal of many negatives and an increasingly more favorable business environment, coupled with our sustained, strong business results, are among the reasons our stock price has done so well this past year. We do not worry about the stock price in the short run, and we do not worry about quarterly earnings. Our mindset is that we consistently build the company — if you do the right things, the stock price will take care of itself. In the next section, I discuss in more detail how we think about building shareholder value for the long run while also taking care of customers, employees and communities. JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember that in almost all cases, the ultimate owner is an individual. Well over 100 million people in the United States own stocks, and a large percentage of them, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Many of these people are veterans, teachers, police o Ưicers, ﬁreﬁghters, retirees, or those saving for a home, school or retirement. Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to perform for our shareholders. In this letter, I discuss the issues highlighted below — which describe many of our successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses. 7 I. JPMorgan Chase Business Strategies 1. How has the company grown? 2. How will the company continue to grow? What are the organic growth opportunities? 3. Why is organic growth a better way to grow — and why is it sometimes di Ưicult? 4. Is there a conﬂict between building shareholder value vs. serving customers, taking care of employees and lifting up communities? 5. Transparency, ﬁnancial discipline and a fortress balance sheet. Why is this discipline so important? 6. What risks worry us the most? And what could go wrong? 7. How is the company dealing with bureaucracy and complacency that often infect large companies? 8. What are the ﬁrm’s views on succession? II. Public Policy 1. What has gone wrong in public policy? 2. Poor public policy — how has this happened? 3. We can ﬁx this problem through intelligent, thoughtful, analytical and comprehensive policy. 4. The need for solutions through collaborative, competent government. 5. A competitive business tax system is a key pillar of a growth strategy. 6. We should reform and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and invest in the workforce of the future. 7. America’s growing ﬁscal deﬁcit and ﬁxing our entitlement programs. 8. Why is smart regulation vs. just more regulation so important? 9. Public company corporate governance — how would you change it? And the case against earnings guidance. 10. Global engagement, trade and immigration — America’s role in the world is critical.

                  "TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Kelly entered 2015 with a clear imperative for growth. 2014 had been a year of aggressive investments and structural change that repositioned Kelly for the future, and in 2015 we faced the critical test of our ability to deliver returns on those investments. Focused execution of our strategy was paramount. As we look at our full-year results, I am pleased to say that we’ve seen returns on Kelly’s investments, and our performance improved signiﬁcantly on several fronts. Driving Results We entered the year with our new operating models ﬁrmly in place, and we gained traction throughout the year as we delivered against our investments and accelerated bottom-line growth. Kelly brought in full-year revenue of $5.5 billion in 2015, up 4.7%* compared to last year. We held expense growth to less than half the pace of revenue growth, with an increase of just 2.2%* year-over-year. All told, in this year of focused execution, we delivered operating earnings of $67 million, nearly doubling the $34 million in adjusted earnings we reported in 2014. Earnings per share were $1.39 — well above adjusted earnings of $0.81 per share for the same period last year. Most notably, we improved the quality of our earnings and delivered outsized leverage in 2015. In total, we dropped nearly 70% of our gross proﬁt (GP) dollar growth* to the bottom line — aƯirmation that Kelly is operating as a more e Ưicient company keenly focused on proﬁtability. Executing Our Strategy 2015 brought renewed commitment to accelerate progress through the strategy that guides us. Our investments were designed — and our actions aligned — to help Kelly move more rapidly toward delivering shareholder value and maximizing returns by: Pursuing higher-skilled, higher- margin professional and technical (PT) sta Ưing solutions Evolving OCG as a market-leading talent supply chain solutions manager Maintaining our core strengths in Commercial sta Ưing in key markets Capturing permanent placement growth in selected specialties Lowering our costs through e Ưicient service delivery models In 2015 we proved this strategy responds to shifts in the market and aligns with customers’ needs — and is a strategy that drives Kelly forward and generates growth. We saw that growth demonstrated in our U.S. branch network as they delivered strong, sustained results in our new PT operating model throughout the year. Our international segments focused on the niches where they excel and delivered growth in the face of uneven economies, with APAC bringing in record-breaking earnings for 2015 and EMEA improving its bottom line. OCG growth continued to surge, most notably in contingent workforce outsourcing (CWO) and business process outsourcing (BPO), as more clients adopted Kelly’s talent supply chain management approach. we are well on our way to becoming a more productive, proﬁtable company with a balanced portfolio that generates MORE competitive returns. Delivering Progress 2015 marked the ﬁrst full year of operating within our newly formed delivery models, and our investment in GP-producing roles clearly accelerated Kelly’s progress in our local U.S. markets. Our expanded PT salesforce won new higher- margin business, while our PT recruiting network e Ưiciently connected clients with specialized talent. PT revenue and GP growth accelerated throughout the year, reaching new heights in the fourth quarter. We expect to see this strong performance continue in 2016 as our U.S. branches deliver outsized PT growth in their local markets and continue to lead in Commercial. In our centralized delivery model, 2015 brought client- speciﬁc ﬂuctuations and signiﬁcant shifts in buying behavior. Large customers are choosing to purchase more of their PT business through competitive sourcing models rather than through single-source arrangements — a trend that puts pressure on our centralized sta Ưing growth, while creating additional opportunities in our OCG business. We continued to adjust our centralized delivery model over the course of 2015, and we entered 2016 showing signs of improved performance. We will continue to focus our sales and recruiting teams on adapting to our largest clients’ needs for PT talent in the year ahead. Our investments in OCG solutions yielded clear returns in 2015. OCG is expanding current relationships, bringing new clients into Kelly’s portfolio, and winning new recognition in the workforce solutions market. We will continue to build out our talent supply chain management approach, equipping Kelly to win in the marketplace and expand our role as a trusted advisor to strategic clients worldwide. Continuing Our Transformation Reaching Kelly’s full potential requires an ongoing appetite for change and transformation. As the world of work continues to evolve, so does Kelly. We are selling workforce solutions today that didn’t exist 10 years ago, and delivering them in ways that simply weren’t possible with our old operating models. We now have the capacity to deliver talent in 140 countries, without opening a single new oƯice, through our global supplier network. In addition to the 550,000 people we connect directly with work through our sta Ưing business, we connect another half-million people with work through the companies that comprise our talent supply chain. Not only have we upheld our reputation as a superb sta Ưing provider, we have also won industry acclaim for our innovative approach to holistically managing talent acquisition on our clients’ behalf. Moving forward, Kelly has set its sights on becoming an even more competitive, consultative, and proﬁtable company. We have, and we are, reshaping our business to make that vision a reality. We are redeploying our resources to align with our goals for growth, intentionally rebalancing our workforce toward client- facing roles that drive revenue and GP for the company. We are challenging ourselves to ﬁnd innovative ways to deliver exceptional solutions more e Ưiciently than ever, without compromising the quality for which we are known. We are truly transforming into a company that designs and delivers the world’s best workforce solutions. Committing to Growth We knew that 2015 would be a critical test of Kelly’s ability to deliver on our strategy. We have clearly passed that test and turned the corner toward growth. With a year of solid execution behind us and a proven strategy to guide us, we enter 2016 from a position of strength. Our investments in higher-margin PT and OCG are yielding results. We are capturing new growth while delivering solutions with e Ưiciency and speed. We are responding to the needs of customers and talent, and leading them forward as a trusted advisor, helping them navigate the ever- changing landscape. We are well on our way to becoming a more productive, proﬁtable company with a balanced portfolio that generates more competitive returns. We will set the bar higher and keep reaching upward, growing our business until our bottom-line results reﬂect the top- level quality of the solutions we deliver. We will reward our shareholders while bringing innovations to market, solving our clients’ most pressing challenges, and creating new opportunities for the world’s best talent. In short, Kelly’s best days are yet to come. With a clear plan for the future, we are focused on delivering growth now. There is signiﬁcant work ahead of us in 2016. I have no doubt we will rise to the new challenges and continue our upward trajectory, executing with ﬂexibility, speed, and conﬁdence. My personal thanks to Kelly shareholders and board members for trusting us to deliver on Kelly’s investments, and to my Kelly colleagues for delivering strong results with the excellence and integrity that have always been Kelly’s trademark. Here’s to a successful 2016 for all! CARL T. CAMDEN President and Chief Executive O Ưicer March 2016 ",
                  "Kelly entered 2016 with a ﬁrm commitment to increased proﬁtability and strategic growth. I’m pleased to report that we made progress on both fronts. Our full-year performance conﬁrmed that we are indeed acting as a more focused, agile company — one that is delivering improved shareholder value even as we continue to transform. We are managing our business with disciplined intent, and in 2016 we demonstrated that our focus on proﬁtability is yielding results. Delivering Results Multiple factors impacted our reported results and complicated our ﬁnancial picture in 2016. Sorting through the complexity, it’s clear that Kelly made progress in several key areas. In the face of revenue softening to $5.3 billion, we improved our higher-value business mix while exercising strong pricing discipline and good cost control, growing our gross proﬁt 50 basis points and holding expenses ﬂat. We also strengthened our cash position and shareholder value in 2016: we added free cash ﬂow, more than doubled EPS to $3.08, and delivered higher dividends to our shareholders — all while ending the year debt-free. Even after transitioning Kelly’s APAC sta Ưing operations into the TS Kelly Asia Paciﬁc joint venture in July, we still recorded a full-year operating proﬁt of $63.2 million. Kelly is indeed operating as a more focused company with a keen eye on proﬁtability. Implementing our Strategy Kelly’s time-tested strategy continues to guide our steps. We are able to deliver improved shareholder value and returns by: Pursuing higher-skilled, higher- margin professional and technical sta Ưing solutions Transforming our Outsourcing and Consulting Group (OCG) into a market-leading provider of talent supply chain solutions Maintaining our core strengths in commercial sta Ưing in key markets Capturing permanent placement growth in selected specialties Lowering our costs through e Ưicient service delivery models In 2016, this strategy continued to serve us well. We managed our sta Ưing operations in line with growth, and increased eƯiciency in both the U.S. and EMEA. While our increased investments in OCG impacted the segment’s overall growth rates a bit in the second half of the year, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) delivered strong gross proﬁt growth as we diversiﬁed and expanded these critical components of our talent supply chain strategy. We continue to add OCG resources in support of increased market and customer demand for these holistic solutions throughout our large account portfolio. harpening Our Focus Kelly remains focused on executing a well-formed strategy with increased speed and precision, making the necessary investments and adjustments to advance that strategy. We have set our sights on becoming an even more focused and proﬁtable company, and we are reshaping our business to make that vision a reality. In 2016, we took actions across our operations to hone our strategy and secure a competitive edge. Our newly expanded APAC joint venture exempliﬁes our focus. In July 2016, Kelly and Temp Holdings formally expanded our 14-year strategic partnership to create TS Kelly Asia Paciﬁc, and Kelly transferred its APAC sta Ưing operations into the joint venture. The joint venture is one of the largest workforce solutions companies in the Asia Paciﬁc region, providing accelerated growth opportunities and enhanced competitive positioning. Yet even as the joint venture establishes a dominant presence in the Asian sta Ưing sector, it also sharpens Kelly’s focus on OCG solutions in the APAC market. Since our global OCG segment remains wholly owned by Kelly, we are now positioned to accelerate our OCG investments in this high-growth market with renewed speed and intensity, seizing opportunities for higher margin growth in the region’s outsourcing and consulting space. Kelly’s commitment to focusing on growth extends beyond the joint venture. In 2016, our local U.S. branch network tightened its structure and made intentional investments in select key markets — a strategy that helped not only protect Kelly’s commercial sta Ưing core, but also perform well against competitors in the face of slower demand. To accelerate future OCG growth, we refocused our global sales teams and added resources dedicated to capturing new business in the OCG space. And throughout the Company, we are continually rebalancing our resources to align with our goals, intentionally designing a workforce that is equipped to drive top-line growth and increased gross proﬁt. Relentlessly Pursuing Growth As we execute our strategy, our sights remain set on capturing the growth opportunities in the global workforce solutions market. We are increasing the breadth and depth of our large account relationships, earning a seat at the table and becoming embedded in our customers’ talent strategies. At the same time, our local markets are becoming more targeted and competitive as they focus on the niches where they can dominate and deliver world-class staƯing. We remain the leader in the K-12 U.S. sta Ưing market, and Kelly Educational Sta Ưing continues to deliver doubledigit revenue increases year over year, meriting industry attention and our ongoing investments. Our OCG segment continues to respond to clients’ complex demands for more holistic talent solutions, and we are conﬁdent we will reap the beneﬁts of expanded large account relationships and signiﬁcant new wins our sales teams secured in 2016. OCG’s strategic direction is sound, and we remain committed to making intentional investments to increase top- and bottom-line growth in this segment. We have learned to adapt to the inevitable uncertainty of today’s labor markets, knowing that the growing trend toward free agency favors Kelly’s strengths — particularly serving large companies. As businesses increasingly rely on ﬂexible sta Ưing models and seek more comprehensive workforce management solutions, Kelly will continue to seize opportunities to win in the market and deliver those wins with increased e Ưiciency and focus that yields growth on the bottom line. We remain focused on proﬁtable growth, connecting companies and talented people with the same excellence and integrity that has been Kelly’s hallmark for 0 years. Ready for the Road Ahead We believe Kelly is poised for continued progress in the year ahead, and we move forward with conﬁdence. We remain focused on proﬁtable growth, and we are proud to deliver that growth by connecting companies and talented people with the same excellence and integrity that has been Kelly’s hallmark for 70 years. As we strengthen our ﬁnancial position, we’re also advancing the position of talented people and large and small businesses around the world. We’re connecting companies with workforces designed around their business strategies, and connecting people with work designed around their lives. We take pride in knowing that even in uncertain times, we are a force for good — not only for our shareholders, but also for the people who work with and lead the companies we empower. My personal thanks, as always, go out to Kelly shareholders who trust us with their investments, and to the entire network of Kelly colleagues, suppliers, and workers who trust us with their time and talents. Carl T. Camden President and Chief Executive O Ưicer MARCH 2017 ",
                  "To Our Shareholders 2017was a year of change and acceleration at Kelly. We created solid momentum and carried it through all four quarters, delivering strong top-line growth that outpaced the market and proﬁtability gains that held strong even as we invested in our future. We bid farewell to CEO Carl Camden after a 22-year career, and welcomed a new company, Teachers On Call, to the Kelly family. We weathered a series of storms and natural disasters unlike any we’d encountered before, standing strong together and caring for our colleagues and communities. We introduced new reporting segments, sharpened our focus, accelerated our investments, and established strategic priorities that yielded strong results for Kelly. DELIVERING RESULTS After entering the year at a steady clip, Kelly drove forward with sustained growth quarter after quarter, achieving a 41% increase in annual operating earnings on a like-for-like basis. Our performance reﬂects our eƯorts to produce higher earnings from both gross proﬁt growth and a balanced approach to expenses. Through a combination of strong top-line growth and good GP rate improvement, we delivered increased proﬁtability even as we invested in the talent and technology that will drive our company forward. Our conversion rate* for 2017 was up 160 basis points to 9.0% (excluding restructuring), another clear indicator that conﬁrms we are creating value along with driving volume. REFOCUSING OUR STRATEGY As the world of work continues to evolve, so too does Kelly’s strategy. In 2017, we took a fresh look at the labor environment and deﬁned a path that is at once familiar and ambitious. Our go-forward strategy is our response to the external realities shaping our industry and the world at large. Talented people are embracing new ways to work. Modern businesses are looking for ways to adapt and ﬁnd the talent they need to move their organizations forward. Kelly is staking its claim as the connection point in a marketplace marked by disruption. Our go- forward strategy is designed to help our candidates, our clients, and our company not only withstand those disruptions, but turn them to advantages. In so doing,we will be able to deliver improved shareholder value and returns from a business that is focused on its strengths and committed to leading where we know we can win. Our plan centers on four strategic pillars: Being the destination for top talent Leading in our chosen markets via scale or specialty Embracing the future of work Investing in technology for innovation and e Ưiciency In 2017, we began aligning our actions to these guideposts, which will inform Kelly’s journey and investment decisions over the next several years. Taken in concert, these focus areas complement each other and drive Kelly forward into a future where we are not only more proﬁtable, but also better able to fulﬁll our mission to connect people with work in ways that enrich their lives. ACCELERATING ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS With our APAC joint venture fully in place, we entered 2018 with reporting segments that reﬂected our new operating reality: Americas Sta Ưing, International Sta Ưing, and Global Talent Solutions. *Conversion rate represents earnings from operations as a percentage of gross proﬁt, or return on gross proﬁt. Growth in Americas Sta Ưing increased as the investments we made in recruiters and sales resources during the ﬁrst half of the year fueled results in all areas. The second half of the year brought additional acceleration as we completed the acquisition of Teachers On Call to further strengthen Kelly’s leading position in K- 12 educational sta Ưing — a clear example of investing where we know we can win, and a notable milestone of our strategy in action. With steadily climbing revenue growth and a marked improvement in GP rates, Americas Sta Ưing delivered an 18% increase in full-year operating proﬁt (excluding restructuring). International Sta Ưing, now comprised of our European staƯing operations, added another strong ﬁnish to the year. For the full year, International StaƯing achieved 44% growth in earnings from operations (in constant currency). Global Talent Solutions—the combination of our previously reported Outsourcing and Consulting Group segment plus our centrally delivered sta Ưing operations —delivered results from our 2016 investments and turned in strong double-digit growth in 2017. As large clients continue to turn to Kelly for Talent Fulﬁllment and Outcome-Based Solutions, Global Talent Solutions is delivering the proven expertise and capabilities our clients seek. For the full year, the segment achieved a 35% increase in earnings from operations over 2016 (excluding restructuring). ADVANCING TALENT & TECHNOLOGY Nothing is reshaping work more rapidly or precipitously than technology. We believe the digitally powered future is one of boundless opportunity for the people we serve. Our optimism is rooted in a legacy rich in innovation and forward progress. At our inception, we ushered in a newly mobile workforce, and as work evolved, we have equipped and empowered people to meet the needs of a changing marketplace. As work is reinvented, our evolution continues. Technology, talent, and work itself are all going mobile — untethering new generations to deﬁne work on their own terms, as something they do, not someplace they go. By executing our go-forward strategy, we will continually assess where we apply our investments to make the biggest di Ưerence, the largest contribution to the people and companies who are powering the world forward. Digital transformation will also involve reimagining our business models, engineering new solutions, and continually sharpening our focus. We will enable meaningful freedom of choice in the world of work, equipping people to bring their skills to the market as independent workers, honoring their priorities, advancing their careers, and enriching their lives. MOVING FORWARD WITH CLARITY AND CONFIDENCE We entered 2018 with renewed focus and clear plans to accelerate the progress we have set in motion. As we look with conﬁdence at the year ahead, we are committed to investing in the talent and technology that will drive our future. We are focusing on our strengths, accelerating our investments where we know we can win, and leveraging technology to connect with talent like never before. I’m proud to stand alongside my Kelly colleagues as we face the future together with renewed conﬁdence, increased clarity, and a deepened connection to the talent that has always been at the heart of our business.

                  "erchant-minded that we’ll continue to connect customers with new items that they want and need. Although technology has transformed our business, retail is still a people business. Walmart has always provided a ladder of opportunity – one that today is available to our 2.2 million associates globally. Regardless of your background, Walmart will give you the opportunity to grow a career as far as your ability and hard work will take you. I am one of many leaders in our company who beneﬁted from this opportunity to begin as an hourly associate and grow into roles with increased responsibility. Talent is the essential enabler to reach our objectives. I’m excited by the new initiatives we’ve put in place around the world to better train and equip our associates for success. For example, the steps we’ve taken in the U.S., China and Mexico to strengthen compensation structures and increase training opportunities give associates more ownership and accountability, so they can react faster to customers’ needs. Adding new talent is also important as we work to grow digital retail and fully align our organization with a changing retail environment. Some of the brightest minds in retail are joining Walmart because they know this is an organization that’s embracing innovation to deliver a better future for customers. Committed to a better world We’re not only thinking di Ưerently about retail, we’re thinking di Ưerently about the world. Walmart is a powerful change agent, and we’re committed to global responsibility initiatives that make our world better. I’m proud of our work to advance environmental sustainability, to support women’s economic empowerment, and to o Ưer healthier food choices for our customers. We continue to look for more ways to lead and have an even greater impact on the communities that we serve. We’ll also remain steadfast in our commitment to compliance, ethics and doing business the right way. I’m pleased with the enhancements we’ve made, including better technology, to strengthen these organizations and build world-class compliance. My career at Walmart began more than three decades ago, and I’ve never been more excited about our future than I am today. Walmart has a great purpose – to save people money so they can live better. We’re embracing change so we can deliver that promise more eƯectively. As I look back over this past year, we’ve made great strides towards our goals. We know where our customers’ expectations are going, and we’re ideally positioned to deliver for them. Walmart has great assets and capabilities, but there’s more we must do. We’re continuing to build a Walmart that excels globally at the integration of digital and physical retail, providing our customers with a seamless experience to shop whenever, wherever and however they want. It’s a great opportunity. I’m excited about the next steps in our journey. Sincerely. ",
                  "Dear shareholders, associates and customers: Throughout our history, Walmart has been an innovator in retail. We’re now living in a new period of disruption, largely driven by rapid technological advances, and that change is likely to accelerate even further. Our eƯorts are squarely focused on emerging as the retail leader. Around the world, we face stiƯ competition, but our future is within our control. We are a strong and proﬁtable business, with unique strengths and assets. Our people, stores and supply chain, combined with our customer relationships and willingness to change, provide the opportunity for us to continue to win with customers. In ﬁscal 2016, we took several important steps to reimagine Walmart, including initiating an approximately $2.7 billion investment in our people over two years and ramping up Online Grocery. And we will move even faster going forward. The bottom line is this: we have the resources to chart our own destiny, we know where we are going, and we will win with a strategy that only Walmart can execute. Our work starts and ends with the customer. Technology has changed customer expectations. Customers used to compare us with the store down the street; now they compare us with the best online shopping experience. And beyond just retail, they compare us with every business they interact with in their lives. They compare our pickup experience to the speed and friendliness of the best drive-through. They compare our checkout process to the ease of paying with an app. Our customers have high expectations of us. And they absolutely should. People have limited time, limited money and limited patience. With so many options and technological tools available today, shopping shouldn’t be a hassle. Our customers deserve and demand value, professional service and a simple, easy experience. And when they’re searching for an item or paying for their purchase, they want it to be fast. Winning with customers today means being actively on their side – making their daily lives better. Customers should be able to shop on their own terms – in a great store or club, with a quick pickup stop on the way home from work, or with items reliably arriving at the front door. And customers want to have some money left over to put toward their priorities: an experience together as a family, a special gift every once in a while, or savings for a rainy day. Retail is not just about putting items on a shelf anymore. It’s about ﬁghting for our customers, cutting out the hassles and the headaches and advocating for them on price, too. We’re moving beyond just selling products to being the brand customers rely on to make their lives simpler and more meaningful as they save money. The winners in this time of change will be those who put the customer ﬁrst. Our plan to win is clear. It starts with unparalleled assets that only Walmart has – our 2.3 million people; more than 11,500 retail locations; e-commerce websites and apps; and a dynamic, optimized supply chain. But it also requires new capabilities and fresh thinking. This includes new digital tools for customers and frontline associates, as well as back-end software and platform work that beneﬁts the entire enterprise. The use of data, algorithms, advanced forecasting capabilities – and more – is of extreme strategic signiﬁcance. We will put these pieces together in a way no one else can. We will reimagine Walmart by being the ﬁrst and only to deliver a truly seamless shopping experience at scale, with great savings and massive selection. We want customers to: • Trust us to save them money, • Find it simple and easy to do business with us, whether digitally or physically, • Know they can ﬁnd whatever they’re looking for, either in stores, on our e-commerce sites, or with our marketplace vendors, and • Get items when and where they want them – in stores and clubs, through pickup on or o Ư-site, or delivered to their door. Ultimately, customers don’t care about what channel they’re shopping in, or about how we deliver them a product or service. They simply know they’re shopping with Walmart. We made great progress against this strategy over the past year. To help our associates succeed and better serve our customers, we’re making big changes – including investing approximately $2.7 billion over two years in higher wages, education and training to make Walmart U.S. a better place to work and shop. This is an investment to strengthen our company, and we’re already seeing positive results: our fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2016 marked six consecutive quarters of positive comps and ﬁve straight quarters of positive traƯic at Walmart U.S. There is an underlying strength to the U.S. business that was not there a year ago. Everything we’re doing in omnichannel depends on customers having great interactions with us in our stores. We're also accelerating e-commerce and technology advances globally. We expanded Online Grocery shopping to new markets, ramped up in-store and in-club pickup, fully acquired the Chinese online retailer Yihaodian, and began to add new mobile services such as Walmart Pay. We developed a technology platform that we can scale across the business. We improved our fulﬁllment capabilities with new centers that are helping us get orders to customers’ doors faster and more e Ưiciently Last year, we also took di Ưicult but necessary steps to sharpen the focus of our portfolio. The decision to close stores is not one we took lightly, but we must do what’s right for the company. We’ll continue to evaluate our portfolio as part of the normal course of business. Overall, we served nearly 260 million customers a week last year in 28 countries. In the United States, more than 78 percent of Americans shopped with us during the year, and tra Ưic was up over last year. Excluding more than $17 billion in currency impacts, we delivered revenue of $499.4 billion, up 2.8 percent, which is $13.7 billion of growth. As we win with the customer, we will also create a great place to work. We will create tremendous opportunities for people from all walks of life, with all kinds of skill sets and education levels. We’re striving to create a true meritocracy. Diversity and inclusion are core to who we are and make us a stronger company. No matter where you start from or what your unique and special characteristics are, you can fulﬁll your potential here. We believe in opportunity and that hard work, dedication and talent should be rewarded. We will also shape global systems using our size, mindset and policies and help make the world a better place. We create opportunity throughout our global supply chain – on farms and in factories, by buying more from women-owned businesses, by hiring veterans and by strengthening the retail industry workforce. We also work to be more sustainable, both in our own operations and in our supply chain. We have three big goals: creating zero waste, running on 100 percent renewable energy and selling products that sustain people and the environment. And we give back to the communities we serve – supporting American manufacturing, preparing for and responding to natural disasters and ﬁghting hunger. Customers can be proud to shop at Walmart. When you put it all together, we’ll enable customers around the world to save money and time, so they can invest more of both in the things they love. And we’ll help make the world a better place one community at a time. We will win with a di Ưerentiated, disruptive strategy and a foundation of operational excellence. As we do, we believe shareholders will beneﬁt by receiving above-average returns. We have a continued commitment to our shareholders that we’re very proud of. Last year, we were able to return more than $10 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This year, we announced a dividend increase to $2.00 per share, marking the 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases for Walmart. Although this will be another year of foundational investments, we believe we will soon be growing faster than the retail market. We are a growth company; we just happen to be a large one. The road ahead will not always be easy, but by being customerfocused, hungry, fast and accountable, we will win and have a good time doing it. Thank you for your continued interest in our company. It’s an incredible time to be a part of Walmart. Sincerely, ",
                  "Dear shareholders, associates and customers: As I sit down to write this year’s letter, I’m feeling proud of the progress we’re making at Walmart and, most speciﬁcally, the passion and hard work exhibited by our associates. I’m encouraged by the way we’re moving with greater speed to better serve customers. Our business is getting stronger. In the U.S., we’ve delivered positive comp store sales for ten consecutive quarters and we’re hearing from our customers that their experience continues to improve. Sam’s Club comp sales improved throughout the year and members are increasingly using our digital tools like Scan & Go and Club Pickup. Outside the U.S., ten of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales this past year. Across our business segments, e-commerce growth is accelerating. Our strategy to serve customers through e-commerce and our stores in a seamless way is gaining traction. The momentum we’re seeing is real and I’m excited about what the future holds. At Walmart, we’re harnessing the power of technology and the investments in our associates to create new ways of serving customers and provide associates with more opportunities to grow their careers. We’re clearly living in a time of transformative change. The world is moving faster and the magnitude of the changes, and their inﬂuence on business, seem larger than I can remember. In retail, the things made possible by technology are fundamentally transforming this industry. These changes are creating compelling ways for customers to save time and gain easy access to products and services they didn’t have before. At Walmart, we’re harnessing the power of technology and the investments in our associates to create new ways of serving customers and provide associates with more opportunities to grow their careers. We’ve been preparing ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities presented and we have four objectives that we’re focused on this year. First, we want to make every day easier for busy families. Customers are timecrunched, so we want their shopping experience with us to be fast and easy—truly seamless—in all the ways they want to shop: in stores, on their mobile device, or through pickup and delivery. I’m excited by many of our recent initiatives—like the free 2-day shipping o Ưer with a $35 minimum order from Walmart.com, the expansion of online grocery around the world, and Sam’s Club’s launch of Scan & Go across the U.S.—because of the convenience these initiatives provide. The strategic acquisitions of Jet, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw and ModCloth, as well as the alliance with JD.com in China, provide customers with a broader assortment as well as more ways to save time and money. It’s truly been a signiﬁcant year of progress on this front. Our second key objective is to change the way we work. We’re focused on becoming more of a digital enterprise. We’re working to increase productivity with more e Ưicient internal processes and creating more real-time information at our ﬁnger tips, supported by more advanced analytics. We’re providing in-store associates with the tools they need, like apps and tablets, to make it easier to gain insight into our performance. Our goal is to increase our speed, e Ưectiveness for customers and productivity throughout the business. We’re also working to strengthen the performance mindset of our culture and ﬁght bureaucracy that can plague large companies. A strong and e Ưective culture is foundational to success and we’re shaping ours to drive performance and create even more opportunity for our diverse group of associates in an inclusive work environment. Third, we will deliver results and operate with discipline. We were founded on an everyday low-cost mentality but we think we have opportunities to work in new ways and ﬁnd a path to a lower cost base. This is vital for our future. We’ll be smart with how we allocate capital to drive long- term value for our shareholders. We’re after e Ưicient growth. We will focus on growing more through e-commerce and comp sales in our current store ﬂeet and rely less on new store growth in the U.S. We’ll also continually look at our portfolio to make sure we’re positioned to win. We’ll invest in our core business with store remodels, technology and customer initiatives like online grocery and pickup, while at the same time being open to divest non-core assets if it’s in our best interest. The fourth objective is to be the most trusted retailer. During this time of change, customers are watching the companies they spend their time and money with more closely than ever. The way we earn their trust is through our associates doing the right thing every day—being creative, curious, ethical, service oriented and embodying our purpose of making lives better for others. If everyone could see inside the company I’ve come to love, they would feel even better about the company. We’re doing things people would expect from Walmart: focusing on lowering prices—not by cutting corners, but by being better at delivering great items more e Ưiciently than our competitors; and constantly innovating to save customers time as well as money. We’re also doing things that might surprise some people. We’ve made signiﬁcant investments in our associates, providing the career opportunities they deserve and skills necessary to be successful at Walmart or wherever their career takes them. Over the last decade, we’ve become one of the most environmentally sustainable retailers (and companies) in the world and we’re raising the bar even higher. We’re investing in making our supply chain safer and more transparent so customers can be conﬁdent that the products they purchase are sourced the right way. And, we have embraced the journey towards the concept of “shared value” as espoused by Dr. Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, which challenges us to create a business model that is not just good for shareholders but better for everyone: customers, associates, suppliers, communities and society in general. We’ve worked hard over the years to earn the trust of those we serve and do business with around the world. By no means am I saying Walmart is perfect. We’ll make honest mistakes along the way, but we won’t let up until we get it right. Our purpose is simple: we save people money so they can live better. We take both aspects of our purpose seriously. We want to thank you for believing in us…for investing in our future. We are a company of the future. As I stated earlier, we’re operating from a strong foundation built by those before us and taking action aimed at strengthening our business this year and beyond. We’ll continue to strengthen our stores around the world, we’ll continue to build our e-commerce and digital capabilities, and we’ll put them together in a way that saves customers time and money. And as they choose to shop with us, we’ll be doing things behind the scenes to create shared value for all so they are conﬁdent that their trust in us is well-placed. Honored to serve "
