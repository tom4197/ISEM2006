"2015 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, CUST OMERS, AND ASSOCIA TES 7 2015 was a solid year for the bank. CVB Financial Corp. was ranked as the “Best Bank in America” by Forbes. This recognition was particularly rewarding as the rating criteria covered ten different financial metrics and included only the 100 largest banks and thrifts based on asset size in the United States. Citizens Business Bank now has 52 center locations and nearly $8 billion in assets. We certainly have come a long way since 1974, with a single branch location in Chino, CA. We recently announced the payment of our 105 th consecutive cash dividend to our shareholders and our 155 th consecutive quarter of profitability. These two numbers have become sources of pride within our company, representing strength and consistency in financial performance. As we expand our footprint, our vision of becoming the premier financial services company operating throughout the state of California becomes achievable. Our financial success in 2015 was a result of many accomplishments made by hard working associates throughout the year. As a company, we earned $99.1 million, the second highest earnings in history. Total assets grew by $293 million, total loans grew by $196 million, and total deposits grew by $313 million. We broadened our geographic footprint, opening new Commercial Banking Center locations in Oxnard and Santa Barbara. In late 2015, we announced the acquisition of County Commerce Bank, a highly-regarded community bank headquartered in Ventura County with four locations. This acquisition expands our presence into the south central coastal area of California, where we now have six locations in the Ventura/Santa Barbara County region. Throughout the course of time, our commitment to our shareholders has not changed. We make business decisions that are consistent with our five core values: financial strength, superior people, customer focus, cost-effective operation, and having fun.

"2015 I am pleased to write you about another successful year for Hibbett Sports. The Company rallied like a true competitor as fiscal 2015 came to a close, with growing momentum in sales and earnings. We look to maintain this momentum in fiscal 2016 as we continue to make progress on major initiatives that will sharpen our game on the fundamentals that have historically delivered exceptional long-term returns. Our model of convenience, brands, and service continues to be the core of what we do, and we will continue to enhance this model as we focus on improving the customer experience. Our competitive spirit is as strong as ever, and we look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. Net sales for fiscal 2015 rose 7% to $913.5 million, while comparable store sales for the year increased 2.9%. Full year earnings per diluted share increased 6% to $2.87. The final quarter of fiscal 2015 reflected the strongest year-over-year increases in sales and earnings, as we took advantage of increased consumer demand through excellent customer service, product assortments, operational excellence, and support from the entire Hibbett team and all of our suppliers. Reflecting this performance, our balance sheet remained as strong as ever, as we ended the year with a cash position exceeding $88 million, no debt, and credit availability totaling $80 million under our lines of credit. Our capital allocation strategy continues to drive impressive shareholder returns, and we continue to invest in our future earnings potential through continued store growth, investment in major initiatives, and the repurchase of our common shares. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased more than 1.2 million common shares, representing an expenditure of approximately $61 million. Our small-box strategy , with stores of approximately 5,000 square feet, remains at the core of our business model and continues to serve us well. This approach allows us to be nimble as we enter smaller areas that cannot effectively support big-box competition. Even as some markets become viable for larger sporting goods stores, we differentiate through greater convenience, excellent customer service, and the unique product focus we offer our customers. For fiscal 2015, we delivered a record year of store growth, opening 80 new stores, closing 19 under-performing stores, and expanding 9 high-performing stores. We ended the year at 988 stores and expect to open our 1,000th store in the spring of fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2016, we expect to open 80-85 stores, close 15- 20 under-performing stores, and expand 10-15 existing stores. We are confident that we can reach our goal of 1,300 stores by fiscal 2019. We made significant progress on our major initiatives in fiscal 2015 and are starting to see early positive results. We completed the rollout of our labor management system, and our stores are using this capability to service our customers more effectively than ever. Our markdown optimization system has been fully deployed across all major categories, and we are starting to see the long-term benefit this system can provide. This system uses a highly predictive and proven approach to quickly address slow selling and aged inventory and helps instill discipline in our merchandising efforts. As it continues to accumulate more and more product history , we expect the system will further smooth markdown trends and boost gross margin. Our new wholesale and logistics facility continues to exceed our expectations, and we have been impressed with the productivity this facility provides. We are especially excited about the ability to hold back quantities of new product releases, which can be shipped later to specific stores as demand trends emerge, rather than experience store-by- store overstocks or shortages. We also recently completed the first phase of our business intelligence system, which will give us better insight into the business and will allow us to make more timely adjustments to better serve our customers. We will continue to drive value from our existing initiatives and are excited to begin our journey on our next major initiative of enabling a true omni-channel experience for our customers. The initiative begins with the implementation of a new point-of-sale system, which will give us real-time inventory visibility across the chain, allowing stores to quickly locate items and improve our sales conversion rate. As part of this phase, we will also implement a customer relationship management tool, which will allow us to communicate with our customers in a more meaningful way. Longer term, with those pieces in place, we will commence the last phase of our omni- channel strategy with the development of a true e-commerce site, enabling our customers to purchase directly from Hibbett Sports online. Our floor plans are designed with multiple aisle ways that allow the stores to be user friendly , feature more product, and implement seasonal initiatives throughout the year. Hibbett Sports continues to target the core footwear , apparel and equipment interests of our customers. We’ve successfully executed this strategy for almost 20 years as a public company , and we have teamed with leading brands like Nike, Under Armour and adidas to offer our customers premium products backed by convenient locations and unmatched customer service. Our brand message, embodied in our corporate slogan “A Constant State of Game” continues to resonate increasingly with customers, as indicated by our MVP loyalty program that increased 23% to more than 4.6 million members last year. All of these factors encourage a strong sense of optimism and confidence of our team regarding the long-term performance potential of our company . I would like to thank over 8,000 employees in our stores, wholesale and logistics facility , and store support center for making this possible and for their continued dedication and commitment. On behalf of the Board of Directors, management and our employees, please accept our gratitude for your continued support and investment with us. Sincerely , Jeffry O. Rosenthal Chief Executive Officer and President 2016 During Fiscal 2016, Hibbett Sports continued to make progress with a number of key strategies that will strengthen our business over the long term and better position us to capitalize on signiﬁcant opportunities ahead. Our core strategic pillars of convenience, brands and service continued to serve us very well as we grew our store base during the year to reach even more customers in the small markets we serve. Expanding our store base will remain a key component of our growth in the future, and we are excited to take this strategy to the next level with the ongoing development of a full omni-channel capability. Our store base will ultimately play a key role in our omni-channel strategy, and we feel we are still in the early stages of realizing the chain’s full potential. Just as in a marathon, where success depends on planning, training and endurance, we are pleased by the way Hibbett Sports competed this past year and are encouraged by the Company’s pace for the future. Our sales performance in Fiscal 2016 was driven by broad- based strength in our footwear business, as we continued to oﬀer the latest styles and technology that drive consumer demand. Our apparel business was weaker, however, and we see this as a signiﬁcant opportunity as we enter Fiscal 2017. Overall, we experienced weaker-than-expected sales for the year and a related deleveraging impact on margins and expenses. Net sales for Fiscal 2016 rose 3% to $943.1 million, while comparable store sales for the year declined 0.4%. Earnings per diluted share for Fiscal 2016 increased 2% to $2.92. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the signiﬁcant progress we are making on our assortments and in-stock position, and feel we are well positioned to capitalize on these improvements in Fiscal 2017. Hibbett Sports again ended the year with a strong balance sheet, highlighted by $32.3 million of available cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, at year’s end, we had no bank debt outstanding and had full availability under our $80.0 million unsecured credit facilities. This ﬁnancial strength continues to support our store expansion program, the investments in major initiatives, and a robust share buyback plan. During Fiscal 2016, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $91 million, which helped drive our earnings per share growth. Late in the year, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase authorization of $300 million, and the entire authorization was available for future stock repurchases as of January 30, 2016. A central and successful aspect of our business model continues to be our small-box strategy, which is based on stores of approximately 5,000 square feet. It allows us to focus on a limited, but more proﬁtable selection and provides us with increased agility to expand to smaller towns that big-box competitors ﬁnd unworkable or impractical. Even as some markets become viable for larger sporting goods stores, we have remained successful in counterbalancing that impact with even more small-town stores, as we continue to deliver greater convenience, excellent customer service, and a more premium product focus. In terms of physical expansion, Fiscal 2016 was historic in many respects. In May, we opened our 1,000 th store. We also entered two new states during the year, New York and New Jersey, on the way to opening a total of 71 new stores for the year. Finally, we expanded 16 high-performing stores and closed 15 under-performing stores for net growth of 56 stores for the year. As a result, our chain stood at a total of 1,044 stores at year’s end, spanning 33 states. Looking ahead, we expect to assume a slightly more conservative posture regarding site selection and expansion, and as a result, we are targeting the opening of approximately 40 to 50 net new stores during Fiscal 2017 – or more depending on the opportunities that come our way. Our primary goal is to ensure that we are opening good, quality stores that can execute well on our strategies. We still feel very conﬁdent that we can expand to more than 1,500 stores over time. As mentioned at the outset, we are pleased with the progress being made with many of our key initiatives. Foremost among these is our omni-channel initiative, which throughout the year came increasingly in focus as greater visibility on requirements, components and timelines emerged. Phase one of this initiative, which is expected to be operational in the third quarter of Fiscal 2017, will be the rollout of our new point-of-sale system. This will provide inventory visibility across the chain, and will facilitate store- to-store transfers in order to complete a customer sale. This phase will also include a new customer relationship management capability, which will allow us to more eﬀectively communicate and market to our database of more than ﬁve million MVP loyalty members. Phase two, which will allow us to use our chain-wide inventory for a store-to- home shipping capability, is expected to be in pilot by the end of Fiscal 2017. Phase three, which is expected to launch in the back half of Fiscal 2018, will enable digital commerce and, once implemented, will be fully integrated with our brick-and-mortar stores to provide a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. Moving forward with this initiative, we recently announced that Bill Quinn has joined the Company as Vice President of Digital Commerce. Bill has approximately 20 years of diverse work experience including digital, marketing, merchandising, sales, customer service, and process improvement. In addition, he brings more than 11 years of experience in growing omni-channel businesses across a wide variety of industries and platforms. As a brand, Hibbett Sports continues to focus on a reﬁned and premium oﬀering of footwear, apparel and equipment that meets the needs of our customers. We salute our vendor partners, like Nike, Under Armour, Adidas and others, who continue to support us in our eﬀorts to bring premium products, backed by convenient locations and unmatched customer service, to more than a thousand communities across most of the United States. At Hibbett Sports, we don’t just proclaim a corporate slogan, “A Constant State of Game,” we live it every day, as do the more than 8,000 employees in our stores, wholesale and logistics facility, and store support center. Their success drives our success. On behalf of the Board of Directors, management and our employees, please know that your continued support and investment with us are greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Jeﬀry O. Rosenthal Chief Executive Oﬃcer and President 2017 During the past year, the retail indust ry continued to evolve due to shifts in consume r preferences, produc t trends, and shoppi ng preferences by channel. We continue to be focused on adapting to these changing trends and feel that our strategy is aligned to capitalize on these oppor tunities in the future. One of the most important compone nts of this strategy is our omni-channel initiative, which will eventually give our customers the ﬂexibility to shop when and how they want while providing them excellent customer service. We made signiﬁcant progress on this initiative in Fiscal 2017 and are excited about the upcoming launch of our e-commerce website later this year. Along with our omni-channel capability, we are seeing some signiﬁcant beneﬁts from our store-typing initiative. We continue to reﬁne our store assortments according to the preferences of our local customer base and are fully aligned with our key vendors to provide the merchandise that is in high demand for our customers. Our early positive results from this initiative give us conﬁdence as we continue these enhancements across the chain. Overall, we experienced weaker results for Fiscal 2017 as total sales increased 3% to $973 million and comparable store sales increased 0.2% . These sales results, along with our continued investments in our omni-channel strategy, led to lower earnings for the year as earnings per diluted share declined 7% to $2.72. At the end of Fiscal 2017, available cash and cash equivalents rose to $39 million from $32 million last year, and we again ended the year with no outstanding bank debt and full availability of our $80 million revolving credit facilities. This balance sheet strength provides Hibbett Sports with crucial ﬁnancial ﬂexibility as we continue to grow our chain, make investments to transform our business, and suppor t a signiﬁcant and ongoi ng share repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock for $43 million. As of our most recent ﬁscal year end, we had approximately $258 million remaining unde r the existing repurchase authorization for future stock repurchases. As you may recall from last year’s letter, our omni-channel initiative is set to funda mentally change the way we interface with our customers and leverage the existing capabilities of our brick-and-mortar stores and logistics facility. The ﬁrst phase of this initiative, which involved the implementation of a new point-of-sale system, was to help ensure we could satisfy the needs of our customers shoppi ng in our stores. This phase is virtually complete and will conne ct our stores in a way that gives them access to inventory across our entire chain. This means that if a store does not have a particular size or style of an item desired by a customer, store personne l can locate the item in another store and have it sent directly to the customer’s home . Additionally, we plan to launch our e-commerce site in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, which will be fully integrated with our stores. A customer will be able to shop online, see inventory availability in our stores, return online purchases to stores, and have seamless access to our customer loyalty program. Once implemented, we feel this initiative will provide a platform to ensure an outstanding customer experience regardless of channel. We are also in the process of enhancing our customer loyalty program, allowing customers to achieve rewards at a faster rate and establishing an additional tier with enhanced beneﬁts for our most frequent customers. One of our other major initiatives, store-typing, should continue to deliver beneﬁts in Fiscal 2018 as we reﬁne this strategy and make the needed merchandising adjustments in our stores. By typing a store as either fashion specialty, athletic specialty or sport specialty, we adjust the penetration of our merchandise categories to better align with local customer needs. All categories remain important to our business, but this strategy helps us ensure that selling space and assortments are better matched to demand. For Fiscal 2017, we experienced some early success in categories such as lifestyle footwear and fashion apparel, and we look forward to even more oppor tunities in Fiscal 2018. Along with our major initiatives, we continue to see signiﬁcant oppor tunity to expand our small-box strategy across the country in unde rserved markets. As an example, we recently opened our ﬁrst three stores in relatively remote areas of California and are seeing very encouraging results so far. We believe this state will provide signiﬁcant expansion prospects in the future, along with many other oppor tunities in other states and in our existing geography. Our compelling line-up of fresh and innovative merchandise from leading brands helps us diﬀerentiate ourselves from the competition, and our strong vendor partnerships continue to provide us access to new, trend-relevant merchandise for our stores. During Fiscal 2017, we opened 65 new stores and closed 31 unde rperforming stores, resulting in a net growth of 34 locations. This was in line with our previously expressed intention to become somewhat more conservative regarding site selection and expansion to ensure that new locations are positioned to execute well on our strategies. These new stores expanded our footprint to 1,078 locations across 35 states, including initial entry into Wyomi ng and California. We also expanded eight high-performing stores during the year. In Fiscal 2018, we plan to open approximately 50-60 new stores and close 25 to 35 existing stores. Over time, our goal remains to have at least 1,500 stores across the country. In closing, let me reiterate the conﬁdence we have in our business and strategic direction. I believe the coming year will begin to reveal the importance and value of the signiﬁcant investments we have made over the past several years – a new logistics facility, a new home oﬃce, various major system upgrades, a new POS system, and a fully integrated omni- channel platform. All of these investments were made to ensure our continued success in the future and to provide a best-in-class shoppi ng experience for our customers. I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work in helping customers every day in our stores and for bringing our long- term vision to a reality. As always, we thank you for your continued suppor t for the Company. All of us at Hibbett Sports appreciate your ongoi ng conﬁdence as we strive to enhance shareholder value. Sincerely, Jeﬀry O. Rosenthal Chief Executive Oﬃcer and President "
"2015 Dear Shareholder, Expenditures in the U.S. healthcare system continue to grow at an unsustainable pace. Containing costs by correcting billing and payment errors, estimated at close to $170 billion in 2015, is one of the most important means available for impacting those costs. Against that backdrop, we saved billions of dollars last year for our customers and identified billions more in cost avoidance opportunities. 2015 was also a year of solid revenue growth, strong cash flow, improved efficiency and increased profitability at HMS. We began last year with 40% of our state Medicaid TPL revenue scheduled for rebid, an ambitious goal of increasing our commercial health plan revenue by 20% and uncertainty about when new Medicare RAC contracts would be awarded. We ended 2015 with our historically strong state Medicaid TPL presence solidly in place, our health plan growth goal achieved and the future of the Medicare RAC program still unsettled. Entering 2016, we have multi-year contractual relationships in place serving state Medicaid programs in 45 states and the District of Columbia. With an excellent record of retention for over 30 years, that business should be a steady component of our annual revenue and profitability long into the future. Our current growth engine, however, is the commercial health plan business for which 2015 was a breakout year. As health plans continue to place trust in HMS for their cost containment solutions, we added a dozen new customers last year and now work with over 250 plans nationally. We also increased our customer base by 2.5 million unique lives, taking the total to more than 85 million, and we sold incremental products to current customers covering approximately 12.6 million of those lives. We expect 2016 health plan revenue growth of 18-20%, placing it on a trajectory to surpass the state government revenue for the first time in Company history. Data we maintain for our customers gives us unparalleled access to a Medicaid database we believe is the largest in the nation. The depth, breadth and multiyear history of that data contributes significantly to the sophistication of our proprietary matching algorithms and clinical analytics. Our extensive customer base also provides a powerful distribution channel for new products, such as the prepay clinical claim review solution we launched last July. Several factors give us confidence that we can achieve our targeted health plan growth for 2016. In addition to internal steps we took last year to increase efficiency, in terms of the implementation of new business and the profit yield on existing sales, there are two powerful macro forces creating a tailwind. The Affordable Care Act continues to boost annual Medicaid enrollment and spending, and an estimated 10,000 aging baby boomers are entering Medicare each day . Most new enrollees are joining Medicare Advantage plans – a growing market opportunity for HMS. In addition to these demographics, structural changes in the healthcare delivery landscape are presenting added opportunities to sell our products and services to payers. The increasing complexity of payment models, including the gradual move toward pay-for-performance, is making payment accuracy more of a focus. High cost Health Exchange members are creating a sense of urgency among payers to find new ways to control costs. Finally, we see evidence that the frequency and magnitude of high profile healthcare data breaches are pushing health plans in the direction of sharing their members’ personal health information with fewer trusted partners – and making sure those few meet high data security standards. All of these factors combined play to our strengths, as many of our customers seek to consolidate their business among fewer and more substantial service providers. In addition to achieving significant revenue growth and improved profitability, our balance sheet strengthened throughout 2015. We ended the year with $146 million in cash, even after purchasing $50 million of our shares pursuant to a Board authorized buyback program. Our purchase of approximately4.7 million HMSY shares during the second half reduced the year-end share count by nearly 4.5%. We anticipate continued strong operating cash flow in 2016, on the order of $20-25 million per quarter and capital expenditures for the full year of approximately $20 million. Those capital investments will be focused primarily on IT infrastructure improvements, product enhancements and new product development. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to make an acquisition that leverages our large installed customer base and complements our core competencies, expands our data analytics capabilities, and/or supplements our capacity to identify and reduce fraud, waste and abuse. Strategically, we are intensifying our focus on the identification of opportunities for new products and new business relationships as growing attention is paid to population health management, member health and risk analytics. We have an internal innovation team exploring how our massive eligibility and paid claims database, sophisticated data analytics capacity and uniquely broad distribution channel may position us to play in each of those arenas. Data sharing among payers presents another opportunity for HMS, as we expect there will be growing interest in developing applications to look across entire populations in a given geography. Identifying and eliminating fraud, for example, is one of the most obvious areas for cooperation among health plan and government payers. The Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership, led by CMS, is a voluntary public-private effort among federal and state government officials, law enforcement, commercial health plans and healthcare antifraud associations. HMS is proud to have been selected last year as a “trusted third party” participant in the group’s activities, which are focused on the detection and prevention of healthcare fraud through data and information sharing and analytics. At HMS, we are in the enviable position of selling our services in a healthcare market where the opportunity to address payment errors is virtually unlimited and growing annually, due to increases in the number of insured lives and healthcare expenditures which continue to rise unabated. Our consistent performance for customers over the years has positioned HMS as a market-leading data analytics company. With ROIs of 10 to 1 and higher, we have a proven record of helping our customers reduce erroneous payments and thereby bend the healthcare cost curve. We approach 2016 with renewed confidence in our business model, strategic priorities, financial strength, dedicated employees and experienced executive team. We also remain firmly committed to maximizing shareholder value. Thank you for your support and confidence. William C.

Adjusted EBITDA also increased, overall proﬁtability and margins improved, and operating cash ﬂow remained strong. In addition, we achieved a key strategic objective for the year by acquiring a care management platform. Beyond our ﬁnancial performance, we are proud to have saved billions of dollars for our customers. Those savings represent an important contribution to bending the ever-rising healthcare cost curve in this nation. Our 2016 commercial health plan revenue exceeded our state government revenue for the ﬁrst time and signiﬁcant sales throughoutlast year form the foundation for strong commercial revenue growth we expect again in 2017. We added over 17 million new commercial lives, including a sale in the second quarter to a single customer for 15 million of their at-risk and ASO members, taking our commercial health plan lives over 100 million. We also sold additional products to existing health plan customers last year covering approximately 30 million of their members, compared to about 13 million in the prior year. Full-year adjusted earnings per share were up 30% in 2016. Operating cash ﬂow increased 22% and year-end cash of $176 million was 21% higher than the prior year-end, even after the $21 million purchase of Essette in the third quarter and $20 million of share repurchases (1.1 million shares) in the fourth quarter. Through year end we had purchased a total of 5.9 million shares at an average price of $11.95 per share pursuant to a buyback plan instituted by our Board in August of 2015. We also completed a tax project in the third quarter – identifying certain credits and deductions that reduced our annual eﬀective tax rate by 300 bps to ~37%. The Essette care management platform, acquired last fall, was the foundation for a new third business vertical, which was strengthened considerably by the acquisition of the Eliza Corporation consumer engagement platform completed in April of this year. Essette was designed and built from the ground up to serve as a “care traﬃc controller” – helping risk bearing entities identify and manage at-risk populations. Eliza is a cloud-based technology platform which provides comprehensive and personalized health engagement solutions designed to improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs by motivating members to adopt targeted behaviors. Eliza has developed sophisticated communication techniques - based on proprietary patented predictive analytics, behavioral science and digital design techniques - to eﬀectively engage members and achieve better health outcomes. We see these Essette and Eliza capabilities as a natural extension of the cost containment solutions we have oﬀered historically, an opportunity to further leverage our data assets, and a strategic response to the need for payers to improve health outcomes and reduce costs for their highest risk members. We believe there will be signiﬁcant opportunities to cross-sell our new care management and member engagement solutions to our health plan and state government customers. meaningful growth opportunities for our suite of cost containment solutions. We currently face some uncertainty as Congress and the Trump Administration consider various approaches to the focused on preserving the dollars they receive than they are today. W illiam C. Lucia July 12, 2017 Safe Harbor: 2017 Dear Shareholder, The healthcare industry is increasingly focused on enhancing the consumer experience and improving health outcomes by better engaging individuals in managing their own health. To capitalize on this trend, we completed an important strategic acquisition of Eliza Holding Corp. (“Eliza”) in April 2017. Together with the 2016 purchase of the Essette care management platform, HMS now oﬀers a signiﬁcantly expanded suite of solutions to engage consumers and better manage their care. With our new care management and consumer engagement vertical, combined with our heritage cost- containment businesses, HMS can address virtually every aspect of the estimated $1 trillion in annual U.S. healthcare spend lost to fraud, waste and abuse. As a result, we are a key partner for payers seeking to proactively manage the health of their members and to bend the unsustainable upward trajectory of the healthcare cost curve. Eliza is a cloud-based technology platform that provides personalized health engagement solutions – at scale – to improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs by motivating members to adopt targeted behaviors. It creates expanded opportunities to leverage our three principal assets – data, analytics and an expansive customer base – and to partner with payers as they develop and execute strategies to become more consumer-centric. We also believe our new oﬀerings will increase member satisfaction and retention rates, while positioning HMS to address other factors aﬀecting healthcare, such as the increasing inﬂuence of artiﬁcial intelligence; a greater focus on price transparency; heightened recognition of the impact of social determinants; and the growing role of big data and technology-based analytics. Eliza can, for example, identify social determinants during member outreach or health risk assessment activities and provide actionable insights to customers, so they can direct their members to appropriate assistance and care. This is important because socioeconomics, education levels, employment status and social networks are factors that signiﬁcantly impact overall health but cannot be assessed from an enrollment ﬁle or medical claim. Our 2017 ﬁnancial performance included record full year coordination of beneﬁts revenue, which was up more than 8% compared to the prior year; full year total company revenue which topped $500 million for the ﬁrst time in our history; and continued strong operating cash ﬂow. Execution challenges kept us from reaching our payment integrity (“PI”) revenue target for the year, but we made substantial progress on several initiatives we believe can drive double-digit growth for our PI business in the year ahead. Throughout 2017, we made investments in people, technology, process improvements and innovation to accelerate the growth we believe is inherent in our business model. We began to see the expected payback in the fourth quarter, and plan to continue investing in our IT infrastructure and expanding our big data environment in 2018. Beyond investing in growth, our priority this year is to deploy capital for acquisitions that complement our core business, broaden our data analytics capabilities or add to our capacity to detect fraud, waste and abuse. We will stay disciplined in reviewing such opportunities and continue to apply rigorous diligence standards as we consider any future purchases. We also have a $50 million share buyback program in place, with $14 million used in the fourth quarter of 2017, which we will deploy opportunistically. Our balance sheet remains strong, with low leverage and a newly amended and extended $500 million credit facility, ﬁnalized last December which increases ﬂexibility and supplements our strong operating cash ﬂow. Our outlook for 2018 includes total company revenue growth of 7-9% and margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points. We will continue to prudently manage operating expenses and anticipate capital expenditures will be roughly ﬂat compared to 2017. Our eﬀective tax rate is expected to be below 30%, as a result of the federal legislation signed into law last December. We plan to reduce the inventory of sold but not implemented business over the course of 2018 as we work through a backlog that grew throughout last year. We also took a number of steps in 2017 to improve the implementation process and will continue to focus this year on reducing the time it takes to produce the ﬁrst dollars of revenue – particularly in our PI business. Our strategic priorities for 2018 are designed to maximize total shareholder return and include the following:  Boost organic revenue growth across all of our products  Utilize technology, innovation and our scalable business model to expand margins Maximize cross sales of our care management and consumer engagement solutions to existing customers Leverage technology to further strengthen the value of our vast healthcare database and sophisticated analytics Seek to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction and HMS employee engagement We approach 2018 with enthusiasm and conﬁdence in our ability to show year-over-year improvement on a number of key ﬁnancial measures, and to continue positioning HMS for long-term revenue growth and enhanced proﬁtability.

"2015 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS Kelly entered 2015 with a clear imperative for growth. 2014 had been a year of aggressive investments and structural change that repositioned Kelly for the future, and in 2015 we faced the critical test of our ability to deliver returns on those investments. Focused execution of our strategy was paramount. As we look at our full-year results, I am pleased to say that we’ve seen returns on Kelly’s investments, and our performance improved significantly on several fronts. Driving Results We entered the year with our new operating models firmly in place, and we gained traction throughout the year as we delivered against our investments and accelerated bottom-line growth. Kelly brought in full-year revenue of $5.5 billion in 2015, up 4.7%* compared to last year. We held expense growth to less than half the pace of revenue growth, with an increase of just 2.2%* year-over-year. All told, in this year of focused execution, we delivered operating earnings of $67 million, nearly doubling the $34 million in adjusted earnings we reported in 2014. Earnings per share were $1.39 — well above adjusted earnings of $0.81 per share for the same period last year. Most notably, we improved the quality of our earnings and delivered outsized leverage in 2015. In total, we dropped nearly 70% of our gross profit (GP) dollar growth* to the bottom line — affirmation that Kelly is operating as a more efficient company keenly focused on profitability. Executing Our Strategy 2015 brought renewed commitment to accelerate progress through the strategy that guides us. Our investments were designed — and our actions aligned — to help Kelly move more rapidly toward delivering shareholder value and maximizing returns by: Pursuing higher-skilled, higher-margin professional and technical (PT) staffing solutions Evolving OCG as a market-leading talent supply chain solutions manager Maintaining our core strengths in Commercial staffing in key markets Capturing permanent placement growth in selected specialties Lowering our costs through efficient service delivery models In 2015 we proved this strategy responds to shifts in the market and aligns with customers’ needs — and is a strategy that drives Kelly forward and generates growth. We saw that growth demonstrated in our U.S. branch network as they delivered strong, sustained results in our new PT operating model throughout the year. Our international segments focused on the niches where they excel and delivered growth in the face of uneven economies, with APAC bringing in record-breaking earnings for 2015 and EMEA improving its bottom line. OCG growth continued to surge, most notably in contingent workforce outsourcing (CWO) and business process outsourcing (BPO), as more clients adopted Kelly’s talent supply chain management approach. we are well on our way to becoming a more productive, profitable company with a balanced portfolio that generates MORE competitive returns. Delivering Progress 2015 marked the first full year of operating within our newly formed delivery models, and our investment in GP-producing roles clearly accelerated Kelly’s progress in our local U.S. markets. Our expanded PT salesforce won new higher-margin business, while our PT recruiting network efficiently connected clients with specialized talent. PT revenue and GP growth accelerated throughout the year, reaching new heights in the fourth quarter. We expect to see this strong performance continue in 2016 as our U.S. branches deliver outsized PT growth in their local markets and continue to lead in Commercial. In our centralized delivery model, 2015 brought client- specific fluctuations and significant shifts in buying behavior. Large customers are choosing to purchase more of their PT business through competitive sourcing models rather than through single-source arrangements — a trend that puts pressure on our centralized staffing growth, while creating additional opportunities in our OCG business. We continued to adjust our centralized delivery model over the course of 2015, and we entered 2016 showing signs of improved performance. We will continue to focus our sales and recruiting teams on adapting to our largest clients’ needs for PT talent in the year ahead. Our investments in OCG solutions yielded clear returns in 2015. OCG is expanding current relationships, bringing new clients into Kelly’s portfolio, and winning new recognition in the workforce solutions market. We will continue to build out our talent supply chain management approach, equipping Kelly to win in the marketplace and expand our role as a trusted advisor to strategic clients worldwide. Continuing Our Transformation Reaching Kelly’s full potential requires an ongoing appetite for change and transformation. As the world of work continues to evolve, so does Kelly. We are selling workforce solutions today that didn’t exist 10 years ago, and delivering them in ways that simply weren’t possible with our old operating models. We now have the capacity to deliver talent in 140 countries, without opening a single new office, through our global supplier network. In addition to the 550,000 people we connect directly with work through our staffing business, we connect another half-million people with work through the companies that comprise our talent supply chain. Not only have we upheld our reputation as a superb staffing provider, we have also won industry acclaim for our innovative approach to holistically managing talent acquisition on our clients’ behalf. Moving forward, Kelly has set its sights on becoming an even more competitive, consultative, and profitable company. We have, and we are, reshaping our business to make that vision a reality. We are redeploying our resources to align with our goals for growth, intentionally rebalancing our workforce toward client- facing roles that drive revenue and GP for the company. We are challenging ourselves to find innovative ways to deliver exceptional solutions more efficiently than ever, without compromising the quality for which we are known. We are truly transforming into a company that designs and delivers the world’s best workforce solutions. Committing to Growth We knew that 2015 would be a critical test of Kelly’s ability to deliver on our strategy. We have clearly passed that test and turned the corner toward growth. With a year of solid execution behind us and a proven strategy to guide us, we enter 2016 from a position of strength. Our investments in higher-margin PT and OCG are yielding results. We are capturing new growth while delivering solutions with efficiency and speed. We are responding to the needs of customers and talent, and leading them forward as a trusted advisor, helping them navigate the ever-changing landscape. We are well on our way to becoming a more productive, profitable company with a balanced portfolio that generates more competitive returns. We will set the bar higher and keep reaching upward, growing our business until our bottom-line results reflect the top- level quality of the solutions we deliver. We will reward our shareholders while bringing innovations to market, solving our clients’ most pressing challenges, and creating new opportunities for the world’s best talent. In short, Kelly’s best days are yet to come. With a clear plan for the future, we are focused on delivering growth now. There is significant work ahead of us in 2016. I have no doubt we will rise to the new challenges and continue our upward trajectory, executing with flexibility, speed, and confidence. My personal thanks to Kelly shareholders and board members for trusting us to deliver on Kelly’s investments, and to my Kelly colleagues for delivering strong results with the excellence and integrity that have always been Kelly’s trademark. Here’s to a successful 2016 for all! CARL T. CAMDEN President and Chief Executive Officer March 2016 2016 Kelly entered 2016 with a ﬁrm commitment to increased proﬁtability and strategic growth. I’m pleased to report that we made progress on both fronts. Our full-year performance conﬁrmed that we are indeed acting as a more focused, agile company — one that is delivering improved shareholder value even as we continue to transform. We are managing our business with disciplined intent, and in 2016 we demonstrated that our focus on proﬁtability is yielding results. Delivering Results Multiple factors impacted our reported results and complicated our ﬁnancial picture in 2016. Sorting through the complexity, it’s clear that Kelly made progress in several key areas. In the face of revenue softening to $5.3 billion, we improved our higher-value business mix while exercising strong pricing discipline and good cost control, growing our gross proﬁt 50 basis points and holding expenses ﬂat. We also strengthened our cash position and shareholder value in 2016: we added free cash ﬂow, more than doubled EPS to $3.08, and delivered higher dividends to our shareholders — all while ending the year debt-free. Even after transitioning Kelly’s APAC staﬃng operations into the TS Kelly Asia Paciﬁc joint venture in July, we still recorded a full-year operating proﬁt of $63.2 million. Kelly is indeed operating as a more focused company with a keen eye on proﬁtability. Implementing our Strategy Kelly’s time-tested strategy continues to guide our steps. We are able to deliver improved shareholder value and returns by: Pursuing higher-skilled, higher-margin professional and technical staﬃng solutions Transforming our Outsourcing and Consulting Group (OCG) into a market-leading provider of talent supply chain solutions Maintaining our core strengths in commercial staﬃng in key markets Capturing permanent placement growth in selected specialties Lowering our costs through eﬃcient service delivery models In 2016, this strategy continued to serve us well. We managed our staﬃng operations in line with growth, and increased eﬃciency in both the U.S. and EMEA. While our increased investments in OCG impacted the segment’s overall growth rates a bit in the second half of the year, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) delivered strong gross proﬁt growth as we diversiﬁed and expanded these critical components of our talent supply chain strategy. We continue to add OCG resources in support of increased market and customer demand for these holistic solutions throughout our large account portfolio. harpening Our Focus Kelly remains focused on executing a well-formed strategy with increased speed and precision, making the necessary investments and adjustments to advance that strategy. We have set our sights on becoming an even more focused and proﬁtable company, and we are reshaping our business to make that vision a reality. In 2016, we took actions across our operations to hone our strategy and secure a competitive edge. Our newly expanded APAC joint venture exempliﬁes our focus. In July 2016, Kelly and Temp Holdings formally expanded our 14-year strategic partnership to create TS Kelly Asia Paciﬁc, and Kelly transferred its APAC staﬃng operations into the joint venture. The joint venture is one of the largest workforce solutions companies in the Asia Paciﬁc region, providing accelerated growth opportunities and enhanced competitive positioning. Yet even as the joint venture establishes a dominant presence in the Asian staﬃng sector, it also sharpens Kelly’s focus on OCG solutions in the APAC market. Since our global OCG segment remains wholly owned by Kelly, we are now positioned to accelerate our OCG investments in this high-growth market with renewed speed and intensity, seizing opportunities for higher margin growth in the region’s outsourcing and consulting space. Kelly’s commitment to focusing on growth extends beyond the joint venture. In 2016, our local U.S. branch network tightened its structure and made intentional investments in select key markets — a strategy that helped not only protect Kelly’s commercial staﬃng core, but also perform well against competitors in the face of slower demand. To accelerate future OCG growth, we refocused our global sales teams and added resources dedicated to capturing new business in the OCG space. And throughout the Company, we are continually rebalancing our resources to align with our goals, intentionally designing a workforce that is equipped to drive top-line growth and increased gross proﬁt. Relentlessly Pursuing Growth As we execute our strategy, our sights remain set on capturing the growth opportunities in the global workforce solutions market. We are increasing the breadth and depth of our large account relationships, earning a seat at the table and becoming embedded in our customers’ talent strategies. At the same time, our local markets are becoming more targeted and competitive as they focus on the niches where they can dominate and deliver world-class staﬃng. We remain the leader in the K-12 U.S. staﬃng market, and Kelly Educational Staﬃng continues to deliver double- digit revenue increases year over year, meriting industry attention and our ongoing investments. Our OCG segment continues to respond to clients’ complex demands for more holistic talent solutions, and we are conﬁdent we will reap the beneﬁts of expanded large account relationships and signiﬁcant new wins our sales teams secured in 2016. OCG’s strategic direction is sound, and we remain committed to making intentional investments to increase top- and bottom-line growth in this segment. We have learned to adapt to the inevitable uncertainty of today’s labor markets, knowing that the growing trend toward free agency favors Kelly’s strengths — particularly serving large companies. As businesses increasingly rely on ﬂexible staﬃng models and seek more comprehensive workforce management solutions, Kelly will continue to seize opportunities to win in the market and deliver those wins with increased eﬃciency and focus that yields growth on the bottom line. We remain focused on proﬁtable growth, connecting companies and talented people with the same excellence and integrity that has been Kelly’s hallmark for 0 years. Ready for the Road Ahead We believe Kelly is poised for continued progress in the year ahead, and we move forward with conﬁdence. We remain focused on proﬁtable growth, and we are proud to deliver that growth by connecting companies and talented people with the same excellence and integrity that has been Kelly’s hallmark for 70 years. As we strengthen our ﬁnancial position, we’re also advancing the position of talented people and large and small businesses around the world. We’re connecting companies with workforces designed around their business strategies, and connecting people with work designed around their lives. We take pride in knowing that even in uncertain times, we are a force for good — not only for our shareholders, but also for the people who work with and lead the companies we empower. My personal thanks, as always, go out to Kelly shareholders who trust us with their investments, and to the entire network of Kelly colleagues, suppliers, and workers who trust us with their time and talents. Carl T. Camden President and Chief Executive Oﬃcer MARCH 2017 2017 To Our Shareholders 2017was a year of change and acceleration at Kelly. We created solid momentum and carried it through all four quarters, delivering strong top-line growth that outpaced the market and proﬁtability gains that held strong even as we invested in our future. We bid farewell to CEO Carl Camden after a 22-year career, and welcomed a new company, Teachers On Call, to the Kelly family. We weathered a series of storms and natural disasters unlike any we’d encountered before, standing strong together and caring for our colleagues and communities. We introduced new reporting segments, sharpened our focus, accelerated our investments, and established strategic priorities that yielded strong results for Kelly. DELIVERING RESULTS After entering the year at a steady clip, Kelly drove forward with sustained growth quarter after quarter, achieving a 41% increase in annual operating earnings on a like-for-like basis. Our performance reﬂects our eﬀorts to produce higher earnings from both gross proﬁt growth and a balanced approach to expenses. Through a combination of strong top-line growth and good GP rate improvement, we delivered increased proﬁtability even as we invested in the talent and technology that will drive our company forward. Our conversion rate* for 2017 was up 160 basis points to 9.0% (excluding restructuring), another clear indicator that conﬁrms we are creating value along with driving volume. REFOCUSING OUR STRATEGY As the world of work continues to evolve, so too does Kelly’s strategy. In 2017, we took a fresh look at the labor environment and deﬁned a path that is at once familiar and ambitious. Our go-forward strategy is our response to the external realities shaping our industry and the world at large. Talented people are embracing new ways to work. Modern businesses are looking for ways to adapt and ﬁnd the talent they need to move their organizations forward. Kelly is staking its claim as the connection point in a marketplace marked by disruption. Our go- forward strategy is designed to help our candidates, our clients, and our company not only withstand those disruptions, but turn them to advantages. In so doing,we will be able to deliver improved shareholder value and returns from a business that is focused on its strengths and committed to leading where we know we can win. Our plan centers on four strategic pillars: Being the destination for top talent Leading in our chosen markets via scale or specialty Embracing the future of work Investing in technology for innovation and eﬃciency In 2017, we began aligning our actions to these guideposts, which will inform Kelly’s journey and investment decisions over the next several years. Taken in concert, these focus areas complement each other and drive Kelly forward into a future where we are not only more proﬁtable, but also better able to fulﬁll our mission to connect people with work in ways that enrich their lives. ACCELERATING ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS With our APAC joint venture fully in place, we entered 2018 with reporting segments that reﬂected our new operating reality: Americas Staﬃng, International Staﬃng, and Global Talent Solutions. *Conversion rate represents earnings from operations as a percentage of gross proﬁt, or return on gross proﬁt. Growth in Americas Staﬃng increased as the investments we made in recruiters and sales resources during the ﬁrst half of the year fueled results in all areas. The second half of the year brought additional acceleration as we completed the acquisition of Teachers On Call to further strengthen Kelly’s leading position in K-12 educational staﬃng — a clear example of investing where we know we can win, and a notable milestone of our strategy in action. With steadily climbing revenue growth and a marked improvement in GP rates, Americas Staﬃng delivered an 18% increase in full-year operating proﬁt (excluding restructuring). International Staﬃng, now comprised of our European staﬃng operations, added another strong ﬁnish to the year. For the full year, International Staﬃng achieved 44% growth in earnings from operations (in constant currency). Global Talent Solutions—the combination of our previously reported Outsourcing and Consulting Group segment plus our centrally delivered staﬃng operations—delivered results from our 2016 investments and turned in strong double-digit growth in 2017. As large clients continue to turn to Kelly for Talent Fulﬁllment and Outcome-Based Solutions, Global Talent Solutions is delivering the proven expertise and capabilities our clients seek. For the full year, the segment achieved a 35% increase in earnings from operations over 2016 (excluding restructuring). ADVANCING TALENT & TECHNOLOGY Nothing is reshaping work more rapidly or precipitously than technology. We believe the digitally powered future is one of boundless opportunity for the people we serve. Our optimism is rooted in a legacy rich in innovation and forward progress. At our inception, we ushered in a newly mobile workforce, and as work evolved, we have equipped and empowered people to meet the needs of a changing marketplace. As work is reinvented, our evolution continues. Technology, talent, and work itself are all going mobile — untethering new generations to deﬁne work on their own terms, as something they do, not someplace they go. By executing our go-forward strategy, we will continually assess where we apply our investments to make the biggest diﬀerence, the largest contribution to the people and companies who are powering the world forward. Digital transformation will also involve reimagining our business models, engineering new solutions, and continually sharpening our focus. We will enable meaningful freedom of choice in the world of work, equipping people to bring their skills to the market as independent workers, honoring their priorities, advancing their careers, and enriching their lives. MOVING FORWARD WITH CLARITY AND CONFIDENCE We entered 2018 with renewed focus and clear plans to accelerate the progress we have set in motion. As we look with conﬁdence at the year ahead, we are committed to investing in the talent and technology that will drive our future. We are focusing on our strengths, accelerating our investments where we know we can win, and leveraging technology to connect with talent like never before. I’m proud to stand alongside my Kelly colleagues as we face the future together with renewed conﬁdence, increased clarity, and a deepened connection to the talent that has always been at the heart of our business.
